For novice traders, FOMO can be a heavy burden to bear. Resisting the
urge to buy Bitcoin (BTC) after a nearly 15% rally, which saw the price
break both the $12K and $13K levels in less than 24 hours, is almost
impossible. Professional traders are more experienced and know precisely
[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) play these FOMO-inducing situations. As data has shown, they were
mostly adding shorts up to October 20, right before the $12K rupture.

Sell-off][1]

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s fail to grasp that being a pro trader does not mean all
the emerging trends are played profitably. Instead, surviving when
things go wrong is the true mark of success. As BTC rocketed to $13,217,
a total of $350 million worth of liquidations occurred, and the futures
contract funding rate shows there was not excessive short leverage.
Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embed rate
usually charged every eight hours. When shorts are the ones demanding
more leverage, the funding rate goes negative. Therefore, those shorts
will be the ones paying up the fees.

Sell-off][2]

The above chart shows that such a situation hasn’t occurred over the
past few weeks, at least not in a significant way. Thus, despite selling
ahead of the price surge, top traders were not squeezed out of leveraged
short positions.

Data show pro traders covered their shorts on Oct. 21 and they remain
distanced from placing bullish bets. This action is supported both by
crypto exchanges top traders long-to-short ratio and the futures
contracts premium.

Pro traders covered shorts but are unwilling to go long  
According to Huobi’s long-to-short ratio, there has been no sign of
aggressive buying. Data indicates that top traders are not confident
that the current rally is sustainable despite some short-covering
activity.

The long-to-short ratio had been relatively neutral until October 21.
Suddenly, top traders decided to short as BTC broke the $12.5K
resistance. This morning, as BTC refused to lose ground, those traders
started to cover their shorts.

Still, at the moment, there are no signs of bullish bets as Huobi’s
latest data favoring longs by 10% occurred over two weeks ago.

As for OKEx top traders, a similar pattern emerged, although the
shorting movement happened ahead of $12K. This indicator remains in
favor of shorts, a trend that emerged in mid-September and has been held
since then.

To confirm whether there has been a change in sentiment, one should
monitor the futures contracts premium. Those contracts usually trade
with a slight premium on healthy markets across any asset class.

Bullish markets will cause futures contract sellers to demand a higher
price to postpone settlement instead of making the sale at regular spot
markets. If the current $13K level has managed to restore bullish
momentum, this should be reflected in this indicator.

As Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data show, the current 1.8% premium
matches the same level seen three weeks ago as BTC hovered around
$11.5K. This data is further evidence that top traders are not confident
in buying BTC despite the 13% price increase since then.

Implied volatility is the primary metric that can be extracted from
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) pricing. Whenever traders perceive an increased risk of larger
price oscillations, the indicator will shift higher. The opposite occurs
during periods when the price is flat or the expectation of mild price
swings.

Bitcoin’s implied volatility had been in a downtrend during the past six
weeks, but yesterday’s move seems to have surprised [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) traders. Not
only did the indicator spike from 55% to 70%, the volume traded on
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) contracts ($575 million) was three times higher than average.

Going by the long-to-short ratio and futures contracts premium, there is
hardly any relevant buying activity from top traders. This lack of
interest raises a yellow flag as on-chain data shows that as the Bitcoin
price surged above $13,000, a record-high 22% of the total BTC supply
was transacted.

This movement could be a potential signal of large entities preparing to
sell. Still, one must remember that unless those BTC are transferred to
exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) deals tend to have less price impact.
