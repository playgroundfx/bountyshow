April 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc is readying plans to introduce
virtual tokens and cryptocurrencies to its family of apps with an aim to
use such virtual tokens for rewarding creators and lending and other
financial services, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

The move, which is reported to be in its early stages, comes as Meta
grows its focus on services centered around the metaverse, a virtual
environment where people interact, work and play.

If implemented, it could also give Meta a new revenue channel and
control over transactions in its suite of apps and services, which
include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and the Meta Quest virtual reality
platform.

Meta's cryptocurrencies, internally dubbed "Zuck Bucks", are intended
for the metaverse and may not be based on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), the FT report
said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta could introduce in-app tokens that would be centrally controlled by
the company, the report said, and such tokens could be used to pay
favorite creators on Instagram or reward people who make meaningful
contributions in Facebook groups.

> "We have no updates to share today," a Meta spokesperson told Reuters
on Wednesday, adding that the company is focused on building for the
metaverse "and that includes what payments and financial services might
look like."

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, said last month that
Instagram will introduce non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the "near-term".

Earlier this year, Meta joined the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a
group of companies led by Jack Dorsey's Block Inc that has pledged to
promote open access to cryptocurrency technologies.
