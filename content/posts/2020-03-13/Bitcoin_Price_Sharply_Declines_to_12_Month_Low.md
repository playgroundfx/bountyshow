Bitcoin price decreased sharply overnight, reaching $3,867, erasing in
24 hours more than 50 percent of its cost on [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis. That was the
weakest result since March 25, 2019, according to CoinDesk’s data.
Meanwhile, Ethereum's second-largest cryptocurrency according to
capitalization value dropped below $100 for the first time since
December 2018.

Bitcoin’s sharp tumble from $8,000 to $3,867 looked overstretched with
regard to technical studies.

It is reported that after the collapse of Bitcoin in a matter of
minutes, it rose to $5,200, and Ethereum at Coinbase reached $122.

Undoubtedly, the broadly followed relative strength index (RSI), which
fluctuates between zero and one hundred, had decreased to 15 – the worse
result since November 2018. One can make a conclusion, that if the
reading is below-30, it means the digital currency is perusing
demonstrates the cryptocurrency is oversold. Correspondingly, the
increase, which followed over the latter hours might be an “oversold
bounce," which happens when speculators see a prior sell-off as a solid
one and ease offering weight by squaring off brief positions.

Bitcoin eased by 10.12 percent, to 5,188 at 1540 GMT.

As for the rest of digital currencies the changes in their value are as
follows:

  * Bitcoin Cash lost 4.22 percent, to 165,50;

  * Ethereum went down by 6.16 percent, to 120,72;

  * Ripple tumbled by 4.66 percent, to 0,1483.

Litecoin was the only among the most famous digital currencies, which
surged by 3.48 percent, to 34,22 at 1542 GMT.
