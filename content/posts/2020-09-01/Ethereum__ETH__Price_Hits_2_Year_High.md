The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), ETH was trading at
$470 at press time – a level last seen in July 2018. Prices are up more
than 100% this quarter alone, according to CoinDesk’s ether price index.
As ether rose by 10% in the past 24 hours, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) added 3% and is
currently trading near $11,940. Other prominent coins from the CoinDesk
20, like XRP, Stellar XLM, [Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cash, and Chainlink’s LINK
token, have all rallied by 2%-5% in the past 24 hours.

![Ethereum \(ETH\) Price Hits 2-Year High][1]

Investors may be entering the crypto market via ether and decentralized
finance protocols rather than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which served as a gateway to
crypto markets during the 2017 bull run, Peters said. On-chain metrics
suggest ether’s price rally has legs. To start with, exchange deposits –
the number of coins held in exchange addresses – declined to 17.99
million ETH on Monday, the lowest level since March 11, according to
data source Glassnode.

Exchange balances have also reduced by over 5% in the past four weeks.
Investors typically move coins off exchanges to their own wallets when
they expect prices to rally. Additionally, the recent price gains look
to have been fueled by strong hands.

The [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market, too, is biased bullish on ether with the one-,
three- and six-month put-call skews hovering below zero, according to
data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. That’s a
sign of call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), or bullish bets, drawing higher prices than puts,
or bearish bets.

Put-call skews have declined sharply today with ether’s rise to fresh
two-year highs above $450. Markets now expect ether to face increased
volatility over the next four weeks, with one-month implied volatility
increasing from 77% to 91% early Tuesday.
