NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - Bitcoin funds and products posted record
outflows last week as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continued to cast a cautious eye on the
world’s largest cryptocurrency, which has seen its upward momentum stall
in the last few months, according to digital currency manager CoinShares
data released on Monday.

Bitcoin outflows hit $141 million in the week ending June 4,
representing 8.3% of the net inflows seen this year. For the year so
far, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) still showed net inflows of $4.2 billion.

The cryptocurrency sector overall suffered outflows of $94.2 million
last week, the data showed.

James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, believes that
despite the outflows last week, there seems to be “an early turn in
sentiment since May, where most product providers were seeing net
outflows and sentiment was broadly negative.”

Bitcoin was last down 0.6% at $35,591. For the month of May, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
dropped 35.4%. So far in June, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was down a modest 4.8%.

That said, ether, the token used for the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), continued
to see inflows, with $33 million this week. So far this year, inflows
into ether products and funds totaled $1 billion.

XRP saw total inflows of $7 million, the largest since April, while both
Cardano and multi-asset products posted inflows of $4.5 million and $2.7
million respectively.

Digital asset product weekly trading volume on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has fallen 62%
compared with last month, CoinShares data showed.

Blockchain data provider Glassnode also affirmed [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s slowdown.

> “The growth in on-chain demand has slowed markedly, with a number of
on-chain metrics showing significant pull-backs,” Glassnode said.

During the recent sell-off, the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network experienced a reduction
in active addresses, down 18% from the recent highs to around 940,000,
Glassnode said. This fall though was roughly half the reduction seen in
2017, suggesting that while activity has slowed, more demand exists than
after the previous cycle’s macro top.

Data also showed that Grayscale remains the largest digital currency
manager at $30.3 billion, but that was down from $33.6 billion, the
previous week.

CoinShares, the second-biggest and largest European digital asset
manager, oversaw nearly $4 billion on assets, little changed from last
week.
