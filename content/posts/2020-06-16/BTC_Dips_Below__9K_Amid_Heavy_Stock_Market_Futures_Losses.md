Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $9,000 on June 15 as a new week produced
fresh selling pressure across macro assets. Data from Cointelegraph
Markets and CoinMarketCap showed BTC/USD entering the $8,000 range in
Monday trading — for the first time since May 28.

Losses][1]

The latest bearish move follows a difficult week for Bitcoin in which
markets almost regained $10,000 before shedding $800 in a matter of
hours on Thursday. After spending the weekend at around $9,400, support
gave way once more as the outlook for the week on stock markets looked
bleak. At press time, BTC/USD traded at around $9,000 amid an attempt to
re-establish the level as support.

On Sunday, Dow Jones futures alone fell 900 points, with United States
markets similarly uncertain prior to opening. As Cointelegraph reported,
Bitcoin has become increasingly resilient to the impact from stocks
gaining or losing dramatically, a process which has become known as
“decoupling.” Nonetheless, hints of correlation remain, with Bitcoin now
at its lowest in over two weeks.
