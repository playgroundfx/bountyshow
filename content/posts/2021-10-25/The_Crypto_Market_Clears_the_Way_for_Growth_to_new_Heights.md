The crypto market continues to be in a positive frame of mind with a
total capitalisation of around $2.6 trillion. Bitcoin received support
earlier in the week on a decline to $60K but failed to take the upside
path steadily. Probably, volatility may increase as the price moves out
of the $60-65K range.

Bitcoin continues to be a market mover and can confidently be taken as a
barometer of sentiment. The cryptocurrency Greed & Fear Index is back in
extreme greed mode at 76. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart’s RSI index for the BTCUSD
pair is some distance away from the overbought zone at 62.

Technically, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s correction at the end of last week removed some
of the local overbought areas after the rally since late September. For
bulls, this opens opportunities for a build-up of buying with potential
targets at $83K. However, looking further ahead, Bitcoin is just
beginning new upside momentum, targeting the $95-100K area. Until those
levels, we may not see a prolonged and significant pullback.

Several Bitcoin-[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s were launched last week, which had a very
successful start and supported sentiment in the crypto market. A few
more may be launched this week, which should keep the overall positive
sentiment in the market.

Of course, this factor cannot support the crypto market forever, and
soon we will start to see the impact of other events.

One such event could be the start of compensation payments from the
infamous Mt Gox exchange. Lenders have approved a compensation plan, and
there is 150K BTC in the fund for this purpose. This is a massive number
of coins, and many who received such compensation will sell theirs.

The first thing to consider here is the many times the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
has risen since the hacking of the exchange. At one time, Kobayashi, the
exchange’s asset manager, became a central player in the crypto market;
this could likely happen again.

While Bitcoin’s price is near an all-time high anyway, the network’s
processing power has never recovered to its peak in mid-May. The move by
Chinese miners to Kazakhstan is probably over, for the most part, making
the country the world’s No. 2 in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of hash rate. If the local
authorities do not oppose the miners’ work, the capacity will continue
to build up there already.

Many factors point to the likelihood of continued price increases, which
could begin to stimulate the strongest FOMO in the crypto market
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).
