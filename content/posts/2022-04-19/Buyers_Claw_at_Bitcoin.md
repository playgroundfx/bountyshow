Bitcoin returned to growth territory with a powerful surge at Monday’s
close, above the all-important $40K key level. A desperate attempt to
hold on to the uptrend line from January resulted in a temporary
success.

Over the past 24 hours, we have seen a 5% jump to $40.8K. Ethereum adds
4.5% in 24 hours, trading above $3040. Other leading altcoins from the
top ten are adding between 3.5% (Dogecoin) and 18% (Terra). Total crypto
market capitalisation, according to CoinMarketCap, rose 4.6% overnight
to $1.89 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance index added 0.3 p.p. to 41.0%.

The cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index declined Tuesday, adding 3
points to 27 and moving into “fear” territory.

Yesterday, the formal trigger for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) buying was reverting US stock
indices in the New York trading session to the upside. However, what is
striking is that cryptocurrencies were many times more optimistic about
this change in trend, suggesting demand has been waiting to surge into
the market.

Also noteworthy is the increased amplitude of growth in the hottest
cryptocurrencies (Solana, Terra, Avalanche), gaining more than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
The buying wave has not yet spread to the entire market, evidenced by
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rising share.

As the market as a whole, Cryptocurrencies are a system of communicating
vessels on several levels. Bitcoin fills the demand first, followed by
the first round of popular coins, followed by a wave of buying of
smaller projects. The further away from the centre, the lower the
liquidity, but the higher the sensitivity to sentiment. NTFs in this
scheme are illiquid, where demand has not yet reached.

The NFT market is about to burst because of rising interest rates,
believes Nassim Taleb, American economist and author of Black Swan.
Previously, he has been critical of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), calling it “entertainment
for losers”.

According to Blockchain.com, fees on the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network have fallen to
their lowest since June 2020. The average transaction processing fee now
costs a user just over $1. The number of Lightning Network users has
grown 800 times in a year, to 80 million, Arcane Research estimated.
Lightning is designed to solve the problem of reducing high transaction
fees.
