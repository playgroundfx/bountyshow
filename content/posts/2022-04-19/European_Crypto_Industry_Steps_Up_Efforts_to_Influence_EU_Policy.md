LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - More than 40 crypto business leaders have
asked the European Union not to require crypto firms to disclose
transaction details and dial down attempts to bring to heel rapidly
growing decentralised finance platforms.

The European Union, like countries and jurisdictions across the globe,
is working to tame the freewheeling crypto sector. The EU is ahead of
the United States and Britain in developing a set of rules for the $2.1
trillion sector.

In a letter seen by Reuters sent to 27 EU finance ministers on April 13,
crypto businesses asked [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers to ensure their [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s did not
go beyond rules already in place under the global Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), which set standards for combating money laundering.

EU lawmakers last month voted to back new safeguards for tracing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
and other cryptocurrencies.

The rules, opposed by major U.S. exchange Coinbase Global Inc, would
require crypto firms to gather and hold information on who is involved
in digital currency transfers.

In response to last month's vote, 46 European crypto industry leaders
and organisations said in their letter that the proposals "will put
every digital asset owner at risk" by leading to public disclosure of
transaction details and wallet addresses. This would reduce crypto
holders' privacy and safety, the letter's organisers said.

The EU is also introducing a wider framework, known as MiCA, to regulate
all issuers and service providers in the EU dealing with crypto assets.
The European Parliament recently approved its draft of the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/),
which will be negotiated with the EU's executive branch and heads of
member states.

The letter asked that the EU excludes decentralised projects, which
includes decentralised finance or "DeFi", from requirements to register
as legal entities. It also said that certain decentralised "stablecoins"
should not be subject to the MiCA [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/).

Britain has said it will regulate stablecoins, as part of plans to
create a global cryptoasset hub.

CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti, who organised the letter, said that
Europe currently had more complex crypto [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s than other regions,
which deterred businesses from growing in Europe.

Diana Biggs, chief security officer at DeFi Technologies, who also
organised the letter, said she was keen to increase the influence of the
European crypto industry on [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)making in Brussels.

> "There hasn't been strong enough or coordinated efforts across our
industry in Europe," she said.
