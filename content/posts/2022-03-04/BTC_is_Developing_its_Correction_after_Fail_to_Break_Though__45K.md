The momentum of pressure on the crypto market was due to the decline in
stock indices, as the Fed gave signals of tightening [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Technical
factors also contributed to the negative dynamics – the inability to
overcome the strong resistance of the 100-day moving average and mid-
February highs around $45,000.

Real Vision CEO Raul Pal believes that the dynamics of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) against
the backdrop of foreign political tensions in the world signals the
onset of a bullish trend. According to Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group,
one of the world’s leading independent financial institutions, BTC could
reach $50,000 by the end of March.

Billionaire [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Bill Miller said that the Russian authorities can
use BTC as a reserve currency. Earlier, the US authorities called on
crypto exchanges to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia did not begin to soften its attitude
towards [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) against the backdrop of sanctions and still advocates a
complete ban on the circulation and mining of cryptocurrencies.
