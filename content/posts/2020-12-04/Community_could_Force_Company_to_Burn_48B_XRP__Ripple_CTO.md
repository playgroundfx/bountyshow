Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz has admitted the company
could be forced by validators to burn its 48 billion XRP tokens,
regardless of if it agrees with the decision or not. The company
currently holds half the total XRP supply and has come under fire from
the community for selling off tokens in the past, although it resolutely
refuted claims of price manipulation and has stopped the practice in
recent times.

In a Twitter thread, Schwartz confirmed that the community could vote
for Ripple to burn their entire supply of XRP tokens, stating that the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) is “very democratic.” “There would be nothing Ripple could do
to stop that from happening.” XRP Ledger amendments require an 80%
approval rating from the ledger’s validators and are activated if they
stay above that threshold for two weeks. In June, validators on the XRPL
notably voted to adopt a new amendment, dubbed “the Checks Amendment”,
without support from Ripple.

The amendment introduces the ability for users to write checks to each
other for a predetermined amount of XRP that can be redeemed at a later
period. Schwartz’s comments come as something of a postscript to an
incident in November last year in which it was revealed Ripple could
also unilaterally decide to burn the billions in excess supply. At the
time Stellar had just reduced its total supply of 105 billion XLM tokens
down to 50 billion.

Schwartz hit out at the Stellar Development Fund for burning more than
50% of the total XLM tokens writing: “Too bad XRP is decentralized or
someone could just burn half the supply and raise the price to 29
cents.” Schwartz conceded that it could be done, explaining that it
would have to be through a non-traditional method like using the tokens
as fees or sending them to an account that could never be accessed.

Ripple has been the subject of long-standing criticism for routinely
selling tokens. According to a report in early 2020 by XRPArcade, the
firm sold an average of 196 million XRP per month since December of
2017. As of April, a total of 5.5 billion XRP had been sold, or $3.45
billion at the time of writing. In the second and third quarters this
year, Ripple stopped selling XRP and started buying back the tokens to
support its price. In Q3, the firm purchased $45.5 million in XRP.
