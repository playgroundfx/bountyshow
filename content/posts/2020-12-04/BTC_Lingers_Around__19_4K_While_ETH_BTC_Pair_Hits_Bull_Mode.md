The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market is back to trending towards bullish territory after a
flat Wednesday made it clear traders were taking a bit of a breather.
The price was able to go as high as $19,607 but lost steam at $19,363,
as of press time. Thursday’s even tighter range than the previous 24
hours is a symptom of lower-than-average volume. According to exchange
data from the CoinDesk 20, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume was at $990 million as of press
time, lower than Wednesday’s $1.3 billion [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume and the past
month’s $1.5 billion average.

Optimism abounds that more fundamentally positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) combined with
market dynamics will lead the world’s oldest cryptocurrency higher. “I
was explaining to my non-crypto colleagues today that the supply and
demand imbalance is just incredible,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital
assets for Swissquote Bank. “We’re seeing some institutional buyers pick
up large amounts fairly frequently, so the others will also be seeing
that [and asking] where are they getting the coins from?” The dry powder
is out there in the form of miner wallets. Their balances have increased
over the course of 2020, with Lubian.com, F2Pool, BinancePool and Poolin
collectively holding over 33,000 BTC, according to data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)
Glassnode.

> “Miners need to cover their operating costs,” Thomas added. “So for
me, it’s clear we’re going to continue going higher in a fairly
convincing way for quite some time yet.” “I am totally convinced we are
a couple of weeks into a bull market surge of as big proportions as the
last one,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader.
“Bitcoin will fly past the all-time high very soon and I would be
surprised if we don’t see a $30,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) before summer.”

That’s a hyperbullish statement from a hardcore [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)er, but Kugelberg
also cautioned that wild gyrations are likely in the days ahead for the
crypto market. “It will be a very bumpy ride with drops of 20% to 30%
every now and then,” Kugelberg added. “It’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the [amplifier
volume] knob goes to 11. If I had time I’d try to surf the waves as a
day trader, but I leave that to others.”

Bitcoin’s overall volatility has been creeping upward since October and
traders will continue to keep an eye on that metric in this overall bull
market. While attention seems to be on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in this market
atmosphere, it’s not the only story in the crypto markets, noted Denis
Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage BeQuant.

ETH/BTC goes bullish  
Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,
was up Wednesday, trading around $611 and climbing 2.3% in 24 hours as
of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). The ETH/BTC pair, which is offered on most
major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s, has been trending bullish on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
charts by technical analysis standards. Since late November its price
has been above major moving averages. This suggests [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
willing to spend some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to scoop up ether.
