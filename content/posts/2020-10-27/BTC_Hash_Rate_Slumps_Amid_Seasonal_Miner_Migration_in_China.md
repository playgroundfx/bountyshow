Mining data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)s attribute a slump in Bitcoin’s hash rate to the
end of the wet season in Sichuan, resulting in many miners migrating to
other jurisdictions. On Oct. 26, Thomas Heller of Bitcoin (BTC) mining
blog Hashr8 reported that roughly 22 exahashes per second (EH/s) of
mining power had left the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the end of
the season the previous day (based on weather forecasts).

Kevin Zhang of mining-focused Digital Currency Group subsidiary Foundry
also estimated a 20 EH/s drop, noting the seven-day average for
Bitcoin’s hashrate was 132.9 EH/s while [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) hash rate concurrently
tagged 112.9 EH/s. Blockchain.com estimates Bitcoin’s hash rate to have
fallen from 151.1 EH/s on Oct. 24 to 116.3 EH/s the following day.

The province of Sichuan is one of the world’s largest hubs for mining
activity. Miners flock there to take advantage of cheap hydro-
electricity during the rainy season and then just as quickly leave. In
2018, it was estimated that 80% of Chinese miners migrate to Sichuan for
rainy season from other parts of the country. CoinShares data published
during December 2019 estimated Sichuan represents 54% of global mining
activity. Heller also shared data estimating the next Bitcoin mining
difficulty adjustment at the end of this week will see a reduction of
between 7.4% and 8.8%. If accurate, the event would comprise 2020’s
second-largest negative adjustment after the near 16% drop that followed
the ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March.
