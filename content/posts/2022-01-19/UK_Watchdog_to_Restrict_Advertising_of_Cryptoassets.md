LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said on
Wednesday it plans to introduce restrictions on marketing cryptoassets
and other high-risk investments.

A surge in investment scams, particularly online since the coronavirus
pandemic began unfolding in 2020, has prompted the regulator to take
action.

The Financial Conduct Authority said the draft rules, put out to public
consultation, prepare the ground for the government to bring in
promotions of cryptoassets under the watchdog's remit.

> "When it does, the FCA plans to categorise qualifying cryptoassets as
'Restricted Mass Market Investments', meaning consumers would only be
able to respond to cryptoasset financial promotions if they are classed
as restricted, high net worth or sophisticated [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s," the FCA said
in a statement.

>

> "Firms issuing such promotions would have to adhere to FCA rules, such
as the requirement to be clear, fair and not misleading."
