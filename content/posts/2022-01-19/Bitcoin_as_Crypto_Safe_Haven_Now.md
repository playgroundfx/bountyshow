Crypto market capitalisation slipped another 1.4% to $1.97trn. Attempts
to rebound with a return above the round level faced further pressure in
the morning.

Notably, this time, altcoins are falling ahead of the curve.

![Bitcoin as Crypto Safe Haven Now][1]

Bitcoin lost 0.8% overnight, and its share of total market
capitalisation rose to 40%. The turning point in the trend was evident
at the start of the week. And it means that the crypto market is
starting to get scared.

Interestingly, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index remains at 24 – extreme
fear – for the second day. These are low levels but do not indicate a
worsening of the situation. On the contrary, the index is creeping
upwards.

Bitcoin is trading near 41.7k, managed to hold above 40k yesterday
despite massive pressure in traditional markets. However, this local
support is unlikely to withstand sustained pressure.

Bitcoin is received support this week as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sold altcoins,
favouring the first cryptocurrency. This spillover is reminiscent of a
risk-off situation, where the most liquid assets are in demand. Simply
put, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is the crypto safe haven.

But everything is relative. Bitcoin hardly looks stable enough for most
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in it. The dynamics of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether near $40k and $3k,
respectively, are worth keeping an eye on this week. A consolidation
below these levels could start the next phase for cryptocurrency markets
with higher volatility and accelerating declines in the early stages.
