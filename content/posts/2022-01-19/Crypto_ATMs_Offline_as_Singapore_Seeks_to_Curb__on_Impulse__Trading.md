SINGAPORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency automatic teller machines
(ATMs), which provide a convenient platform for trading in digital
tokens, are being taken offline in Singapore, as its central bank limits
consumer advertising of crypto.

Crytocurrency ATMs enable users to trade digital payment tokens (DPT)
like Bitcoin and Ether with fiat money, or government-issued currency.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) in new guidelines announced
on Monday, said such convenient access may mislead the public to trade
"on impulse".

Daenerys & Co, the biggest crypto ATM operator in the city-state in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its footprint, has shut down all of its crypto ATMs to comply
with the guidelines, which it said came as a surprise.

> "To comply with the sudden announcement, we have ceased to offer buy
or sell services via our five ATMs while seeking further clarification
from the MAS," Daenerys said in response to Reuters queries.

Another crypto ATM operator, Deodi Pte, on its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) said it had also
shut down its sole ATM in compliance with the guidelines.

Both Daenerys and Deodi are among the more than 100 firms that have
applied to the MAS for a license to offer DPT services.
