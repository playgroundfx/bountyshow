LAGOS/LONDON (Reuters) - Four months ago, Abolaji Odunjo made a
fundamental change to his business selling mobile phones in a bustling
street market in Lagos: He started paying his suppliers in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Odunjo sources handsets and accessories from China and the United Arab
Emirates. His Chinese suppliers asked to be paid in the cryptocurrency,
he said, for speed and convenience.

The shift has boosted his profits, as he no longer has to buy dollars
using the Nigerian naira or shell out fees to money-transfer firms. It
is also one example of how, in Africa, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) - the original and
biggest cryptocurrency - is finding the practical use that it has
largely failed to elsewhere.

> “Bitcoin helped to protect my business against the currency
devaluation, and enabled me to grow at the same time,” Odunjo told
Reuters from his two-by-eight metre shop.

>

> “You don’t have to pay charges, you don’t have to buy dollars,” the 30
-year-old said, raising his voice above the sound of loud haggling and
the honking horns of scooters.

Odunjo is one of many people at the heart of a quiet [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) boom in
Africa, driven by payments from small businesses as well as remittances
sent home from migrant workers, according to data shared exclusively
with Reuters and interviews with around 20 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) users and five
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s.

Monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from Africa of under $10,000 -
typically made by individuals and small businesses - jumped more than
55% in a year to reach $316 million in June, the data from U.S.
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) research firm Chainalysis shows.

The number of monthly transfers also rose by almost half, surpassing
600,700, according to Chainalysis, which says the research is the most
comprehensive effort yet to map out global crypto use. Much of the
activity took place in Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy, along
with South Africa and Kenya.

This represents a reversal for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) which, despite its birth as a
payments tool over a decade ago, has mainly been used for speculation by
financial traders rather than for commerce.

Why a boom in Africa? Young, tech-savvy populations that have adapted
quickly to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/); weaker local currencies that make it harder to get
dollars, the de facto currency of global trade; and complex bureaucracy
that complicates money transfers.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) users interviewed by Reuters, based in five countries from
Nigeria to Botswana, said the cryptocurrency was helping people make
their businesses nimbler and more profitable, and helping those working
in places like Europe and North America hang on to more of the earnings
they send home.

Yet risks abound.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are unregulated in many countries and
their legal status is unclear, meaning there is no safety net and little
recourse if you lose funds.

For many, converting local currencies to and from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) relies on
informal brokers. Prices are volatile, and buying and selling is a
complex process that demands technical knowledge.

In 2018, the Nigerian central bank warned cryptocurrencies were not
legal tender, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were unprotected.

### TO SHANGHAI WITH CRYPTO

A steady stream of customers comes and goes from Odunjo’s shop, one of a
dozen units along a dark corridor in an indoor section of the market
known as Computer Village.

Odunjo makes two or three transfers a month of around 0.5-0.7 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
($5,900-$8,300) each, to suppliers in Shanghai and Zhangzhou. East Asia,
Chainalysis found, is one of the top partners for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading with
Africa.

Odunjo’s trades offer a microcosm of the wider trends at play in both
Nigeria and across the continent.

In Nigeria, small cryptocurrency transfers totalled nearly $56 million
in June, nearly 50% more than a year before. The number of transactions
jumped over 55% to 120,000.

Gauging how cryptocurrencies are used in particular locations is tough,
though. Digital coins offer a high degree of anonymity, and though the
value of transactions can be tracked on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), the identity or
whereabouts of a user cannot.

Chainalysis, which tracks crypto flows for financial firms and U.S. law
enforcement, gathered the data by analysing web traffic and trading
patterns, though locations can be obscured by virtual private networks.
It separated transfers of under $10,000 from larger sums common among
professional traders.

### NAIRA’S LOSS, BITCOIN’S GAIN

With Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy rocked by low crude prices and
COVID-19, the central bank has twice devalued the naira this year. As a
result, Odunjo and other importers must pay more to buy increasingly
scarce dollars.

The naira’s fall has pushed many Nigerians towards [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the
interviews showed, as they seek methods of purchasing goods from
overseas without having to buy dollars.

Sylvester Kalu, who runs a clothing starch maker in Uyo, eastern
Nigeria, uses [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to buy supplies from Istanbul and Shenzhen.

> “Everything is oil. When the price of oil dropped, forex became
scare,” he said. “That became a very big problem.”

The 30-year-old said his transactions totalled around 2 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
($20,000) a time, adding: “I don’t need anyone in the banks, I don’t
need a person to use the back door to get dollars.”

Timi Ajiboye, who runs Lagos exchange BuyCoins, said its monthly
cryptocurrency volumes jumped over three-fold to $21 million in June
after the naira was devalued in March.

Exchanges across Africa spoke of a similar boom.

Yellow Card, which operates in five countries, said its monthly crypto
volumes had jumped five-fold in 2020 to $25 million in August. A big
driver was workers using [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) for remittances, it added.

Luno said the combined monthly [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading volumes of all market
participants in South Africa and Nigeria had jumped by half this year to
more than $536 million in August.

### IT’S A RISKY BUSINESS

For some people working abroad, in other continents or other African
countries, sending money home via [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) can be quicker and cheaper.

A Nigerian worker in London sending 100 pounds ($132) in cash to Lagos
via a big traditional money-transfer firm, for example, would pay fees
of around 5%. Costs are lower when sending larger amounts or using a
debit card, but the exchange rates on offer are typically several
percentage points less favourable than the market rate.

Bitcoin fees vary depending on the exchange or broker, but would
typically total about 2%-2.5% for sending 100 pounds.

However both exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers carry risks,
from hacks to scams.

And [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), while handy for transfers, isn’t much use on the ground -
shops and landlords rarely accept it, for instance. This means friends
or family sent funds by workers must convert it back to traditional
currency, often via a broker at their end, introducing additional risk.

Yet the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) users interviewed said many OTC brokers, who rely on
word-of-mouth reviews, functioned reliably in an increasingly
competitive market and were loath to imperil the reputations they needed
to stay in business.

And for a growing number of people, the potential rewards outweigh the
pitfalls.

> “People are very adoptive of any technology that will make their life
easier,” said Frankline Kihiu, a crypto broker in Kenya’s capital,
Nairobi.

>

> “In most African countries, there are lots of government restrictions
that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) takes away.”
