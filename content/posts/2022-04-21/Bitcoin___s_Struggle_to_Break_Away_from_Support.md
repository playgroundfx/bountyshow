![Bitcoin’s Struggle to Break Away from Support][1]

The cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index is now in its third day, staying
at 27 points (fear), but we see a slight upward movement in the market.

In the crypto market, as in the high-tech Nasdaq, we can call it
cautious demand from buyers of the deep, but this support is not turning
into a rally. The strong correlation between the tech sector and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
is holding the latter back.

That said, the very fact that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has managed to lock in an uptrend
and attempts to push back from that support is setting up positives for
the coming days.

Bitcoin’s uptrend of the last four months can be extended to the left,
and then it appears to be close to the July 2021 low, which was then
near 30k. If we are right, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and subsequently the entire crypto
market, are saved from falling into a crypto winter by long-term buyers
who find the current levels quite attractive.

Glassnode does not rule out that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has already formed its
“bottom”, although it cannot yet break out of its range formed since
February. The process of redistributing coins from speculative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to “hodlers” is likely already complete, which will reduce selling
pressure going forward.

According to BitInfoCharts, the world’s third-largest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) whale has
acquired 2,822 BTC worth $117 million in the past seven days. In 2022,
3.6 million Americans will use cryptocurrency to make purchases, a
report by research firm Insider Intelligence predicts. The number of
cryptocurrency users in the US is expected to rise to 33.7 million by
the end of this year.
