Bitcoin closed in on the lowest in three weeks as the cryptocurrency’s
sizzlying rally gives way to pessimism that prices are too high.

Bitcoin tumbled 5.9% on Thursday, sliding below $33,000. The largest
digital asset has trended lower ever since breaking through $40,000 amid
growing speculation that the market is in a bubble.

While the soaring crypto prices fueled a speculative mania among the
Robinhood crowd, it’s also made professional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s reluctant to buy
at the top. The debate continues to rage over Bitcoin’s perceived value,
with believers pointing to factors such as institutional interest in the
cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge. Others see the return of another
speculative bubble echoing its 2017 collapse.

> “Bitcoin just entered the danger zone,” wrote Edward Moya, senior
analyst at Oanda. “This doesn’t seem like the end for the crypto bubble,
you just might need to see Bitcoin drop to $30,000 level before that
institutional money sees value in it.”
