BlackRock Inc is adding [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures as an eligible investment to two
funds, a company filing showed, in a move to bring the world of
cryptocurrency to its clients.

The world’s largest asset manager said it could use [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) derivatives
for its funds BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock
Global Allocation Fund Inc.

The funds will invest only in cash-settled [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures traded on
commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Wednesday.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had said at the Council of Foreign
Relations in December that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is seeing big giant moves every day
and could possibly evolve into a global market.

Earlier this month, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency,
hit a record high of $40,000, rallying more than 900% from a low in
March and having only just breached $20,000 in mid-December.

A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment beyond the filings when
