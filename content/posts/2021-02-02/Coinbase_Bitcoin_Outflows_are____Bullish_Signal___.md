Recent Bitcoin (BTC) outflows from Coinbase are reminiscent of the
“proof-of-keys” days and could be a sign of a bullish future, according
to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Data from the cryptocurrency analysis
firm shows that more than 15,200 BTC, currently worth over $515 million,
were withdrawn from Coinbase on Jan. 31.

According to Ki Young Ju, the withdrawal “went to custody wallets that
only have in-going transactions,” and was likely an “OTC deal from
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s” based on several identifiers. He also pointed
to the fact that the split of a 15,000 BTC wallet into wallets
containing 1,000-5,000 BTC increases security costs. Furthermore, most
of the internal transfers are done with round amounts, like 1,000 to
5,000 Bitcoin, while this transfer included odd groupings of 1,265,
2,391, and 1,957 BTC.

As to why Coinbase outflows are a bullish sign for the top
cryptocurrency, Ki Young Ju linked to a previous tweet from Dec. 18
which states that “if Coinbase moves a significant amount of Bitcoins to
other cold wallets, it indicates OTC deals” which are non-exchange
transactions.

> He said: “Since the price is eventually determined on exchanges,
massive non-exchange transaction volume is considered as a bullish
signal. These transactions include OTC deals.”

The slow inflow of institutions into the cryptocurrency sector is
helping to increase the legitimacy of the crypto sector as a whole and
appears to be providing a certain level of support for the price of BTC
as the available supply continues to be locked away in cold custodial
wallets.
