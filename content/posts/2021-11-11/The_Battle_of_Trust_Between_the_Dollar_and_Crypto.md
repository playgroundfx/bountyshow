It could very well be that yesterday we saw the start of a crucial
battle for confidence in the financial system. The acceleration in US
price growth to 6.2% y/y first was taken as a loss of control by the Fed
over inflation. More accurately, assessments by speculators and small
players as to what the market would think of this.

![The Battle of Trust Between the Dollar and Crypto][1]

As a result, we saw a powerful rally in cryptocurrencies and precious
metals, which added more than 2% shortly after the data release. Bitcoin
set a new all-time high of $69K. Buying non-inflationary assets was
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ first reaction to US price data. This reaction put the US on
par with emerging markets, from which [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are fleeing on signs
that the central bank is failing to curb prices.

A sustained reaction of this type would have had far-reaching
consequences. However, towards the close of the US session, the debt
market began to lay down more decisive and speedy Fed rate hikes, which
triggered a strong capital inflow into the Dollar and reversed the
initial reaction. In effect, this is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). At least for
now.

At the close of the US session, BTCUSD found itself pushed back to the
$64.5K area, 6.5% below peak, where it will consolidate in a narrow
range. The fall in the major altcoins was commensurate, but given the
initial surge, the losses over the day are not that great – 3% for BTC,
-1.5% ETH and -2.2% for total cryptocurrency capitalisation.

Perhaps in the coming days, we will have to find out which side is
right. At the end of the day on Wednesday, traditional financials should
still win. The sell-off in cryptocurrencies and the Dollar’s highs
against a basket of major currencies for more than a year speaks to the
belief of “deep pockets” that the Fed has enough gunpower to fight
inflation, and it will use it.
