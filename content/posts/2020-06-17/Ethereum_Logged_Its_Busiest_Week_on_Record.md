It’s costing more to use Ethereum and that may be because more users are
flocking to the platform than ever before, according to one key on-chain
metric. Analysts say the growth of both transactions and the cost to
process them is being driven by an increase in stablecoin usage and DeFi
applications.

The seven-day moving average of the total amount of “gas” used in
transactions on Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) rose to a record high of 61.12
billion on Monday, having surpassed the previous high of 60.07 billion
reached in September 2019, according to data provided by the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
analytics firm CoinMetrics.

Gas is a token that powers Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). It is the unit used to
calculate the amount of fees a user needs to pay in order to transfer
[smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) data or payments on Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). Meanwhile,
ether is the reward paid to miners and is equivalent to the amount of
gas needed to execute a transaction.

> “The increase in gas usage indicates a continuous growth in the use of
Ethereum’s platform, as measured by the number of transactions, as well
as demand for block space, as measured via gas per transaction,” said
Wilson Withiam, research analyst at data provider Messari.

Ethereum’s transaction count recently hit a 27-month high of 938,265 and
was up nearly 45% from lows seen in January as of Monday, according to
Glassnode.

Tether and DeFi fuel growth

> “As both tether and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Ethereum have
exhibited phenomenal growth, Ethereum gas usage has skyrocketed to all-
time highs,” Kyle Davies, co-founder and chairman at Three Arrows
Capital.

Indeed, the use of the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin tether (USDT) on
Ethereum has increased sharply this year.

The number of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) USDT transactions on Ethereum have surged by 450% on
a year-to-date basis, as per CoinMetrics.

Tether has been issued on Ethereum since November 2017 and the platform
now holds 65% of tether’s total supply. “Almost $6 billion of USDT’s
total supply is now on Ethereum, up from $1.5 billion in the beginning
of 2020,” Bendik Norheim Schei, research analyst at Arcane Research,
told CoinDesk.

Further, tether has 10 times more transactions on Ethereum than any
other ERC-20 token. Meanwhile, as per Ether Gas Station, tether
transactions have paid over $2.5 million worth of fees on Ethereum in
the last 30 days. That makes USDT the largest “gas payer” on Ethereum.

Tether and stablecoins in general have witnessed phenomenal growth this
year amid the coronavirus-induced volatility in traditional markets.
Total supply of all stablecoins has surpassed the $11 billion mark this
week, doubling its value since February, according to Messari data.

Even so, the increase in the gas usage is not entirely due to tether.
Ethereum-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Kyber, Uniswap and
IDEX have all experienced solid growth in transaction volumes this year.

Kyber Network registered a transaction volume of $609 million in the
first five months of this year. That’s 1.5 times more than the volume of
$388 million seen in 2019, according to the official blog.

> “Another factor responsible for the increase in gas usage may be
people gaming the network by paying more in gas fees in order to beat
other transactions into a block to gain profit,” said Connor
Abendschein, analyst at Digital Assets Data.

Miners prioritize transactions offering higher fees when the network
faces congestion; that is, the number of transactions waiting to get
confirmed by miners rises to high levels. That forces other users to
offer higher fees.

Ethereum’s network has been facing congestion since early March,
possibly due to increased price volatility and the surge in tether
transactions. As of June 8, there were 19,922,385 unconfirmed
transactions – up 225% from the March 1 tally of 611,872, according to
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data company Amberdata.
