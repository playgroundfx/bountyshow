![Binance.US Could Go Public in 3 Years, CEO Zhao Says][1]

Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of one of the world’s largest exchanges,
Binance, says its U.S. affiliate is eyeing an initial public offering
within three years. According to a report by The Information on
Wednesday, Zhao said “Binance.US is just going to do what Coinbase did”
by following in the footsteps of Brian Armstrong’s exchange.

The move to go public would be a boon for the embattled Binance brand,
with several countries having announced investigations into or published
warnings against Binance. A spokesperson for Binance confirmed with
CoinDesk that Zhao had revealed a projected timeline during an interview
with the publication and underscored his response as being dependent on
market factors.

Asked during the interview about a clear sense of what the timing would
be for Binance.US’s initial public offering, Zhao said it depended on
the business’ growth. Zhao had first brought the idea that its U.S.
affiliate was eyeing an IPO during his time at the Redefine Tomorrow
event in July. The timeline is highly dependent on a number of factors,
including regulatory approval. Binance.US is also eyeing the completion
of a large private funding round within the next two months that would
see the exchange’s CEO reduce control of the U.S. affiliate’s board,
according to the report. Earlier this year, the CEO said parent Binance
had no plans to go public, citing comfort with its overall growth and
cash reserves.
