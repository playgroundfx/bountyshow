LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Britain's ETC Group said on Thursday it will
this month list five new "exchange traded cryptocurrencies" at the
Frankfurt stock exchange, adding to the glut of exchange-traded products
at European exchanges.

Exchange-traded cryptocurrency products are seen as boosting access to
the emerging asset class for a wider group of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Proponents say
they reduce risk of exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as opaque markets
and security flaws in related infrastructure.

The so-called ETCs, which will list on the Deutsche Borse's electronic
trading platform Xetra, are based on "altcoins" - smaller
cryptocurrencies that have been launched in the wake of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s
growth. They include Solana, Cardano and Polkadot - the fifth, sixth and
ninth largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation.

Altcoins tend to rise and fall in tandem with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and are often
plagued by high volatility.

ETC Group listed [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)-traded products (ETPs) in
Paris, Amsterdam and London in June. Investment firm WisdomTree,
meanwhile, also offers ETPs in countries including Germany and
Switzerland.
