Over the past 24 hours, cryptocurrency market capitalisation, according
to CoinMarketCap, has fallen 5.2% overnight to $1.85 trillion, with the
Bitcoin Dominance Index dropping 0.2 points to 41.1%.

The cryptocurrency fear and greed index lost 12 points to 20 by Tuesday,
in a state of “extreme fear”.

Bitcoin collapsed on Monday, the most in almost two months, following
global stock indices. In a sharp move, BTC plummeted under the 50-day
moving average, dashing hopes that we saw a trend breakdown in March.

Yesterday’s drop in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the continued pessimistic mood in
financial markets open a direct and quick path to the March support area
– near $38K, or even lower – to $32.5-35K.

Conventional financial market participants have just started laying down
the accelerated pace of rate hikes, expecting 50 points in May and the
same amount in June. This is in stark contrast to the 25 point rises per
quarter that we have seen since the global financial crisis. In this
environment, liquidity leaves the financial markets, hitting the highest
risk sectors the hardest. Because of this, we see a steep drop in
cryptocurrency capitalisation and the Nasdaq index.

According to CryptoQuant, miners dumped some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s last week as the
cryptocurrency declined. Bearish sentiment may dominate this week as the
BTC exchange balance has risen again.

The cryptocurrency market is threatened by a decline in US stock indices
soon, according to BitMEX [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) co-founder Arthur
Hayes. Bitcoin could fall to $30,000 by the second quarter, Ethereum to
$2,500.

David Rubenstein, the co-founder of The Carlyle Group, believes that
cryptocurrencies will increase amid growth in the crypto industry and
political instability.

According to a Nasdaq survey, 72% of financial advisers would invest
client funds in cryptocurrencies if they had access to spot crypto-[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.
