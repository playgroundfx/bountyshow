MUMBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India will impose a tax of 30% on income from
cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, finance minister Nirmala
Sitharaman said while presenting the federal budget on Tuesday.

Aside from placing earnings from cryptocurrencies and non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) in India's highest tax band, Sitharaman also said losses
from their sale could not be offset against other income, delivering
another disincentive to trading and investment in digital assets.

Industry estimates suggest there are 15 million to 20 million crypto
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion
rupees ($5.37 billion). No official data is available on the size of the
Indian crypto market.

Proponents of digital currencies have been hoping that the establishment
of a formal tax framework could at least spare the crypto industry from
some of the more draconian measures that the government had been
considering.

> "Thirty percent tax on income from virtual digital assets, while high,
is a positive step as it legitimises crypto and hints at an optimistic
sentiment towards further acceptance of crypto and NFTs," said Avinash
Shekhar, chief executive of ZebPay, a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/).

Tax consultants reckoned individuals could end up paying more than 30%
of their crypto profits in tax and other charges.

> "If you made a profit of 100 rupees then including the 30% tax
bracket, plus surcharge and cess the total tax outgo will be around 42
rupees," Amit Maheshwari, partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting
firm told Reuters.

Crypto exchanges also hoped the the new tax regime would signal
acceptance of digitial currencies by the authorities, and reassure
corporates that they can enter the market.

> "We also hope this development removes any ambiguity for banks and
they can provide financial services to the crypto industry," said
Nischal Shetty, CEO, WazirX, another virtual currency exchange.

India's central bank has voiced "serious concerns" around private
cryptocurrencies on the grounds that these could cause financial
instability. As a result, several banks severed ties with crypto firms.

The finance minister also said that the central bank will introduce a
digital currency in the next financial year using [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and other
supporting technology.

> "The introduction of a central bank digital currency will give a big
boost to the digital economy. Digital currency will also lead to a more
efficient and cheaper currency management system," Sitharaman added.
