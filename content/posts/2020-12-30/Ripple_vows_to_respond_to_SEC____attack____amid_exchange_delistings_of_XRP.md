With XRP plunging in value following a wave of exchange delistings and
trading suspensions, Ripple Labs issued a statement Tuesday vowing to
respond to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s
allegations against the company.

The statement opens with the following message: “The public and press
have only heard the story from the SEC’s side, and we’ll be filing our
response in a few weeks to address these unproven allegations against
Ripple.”

The statement claims that the SEC is using Ripple to bring down the
entire cryptocurrency industry in the United States and that, for years,
the company has sought regulatory clarity on digital assets to no avail.
Some observers believe Coinbase’s decision to suspend XRP in January
could be the death knell for the digital asset as Ripple embarks on
multi-year litigation with the SEC. Coinbase announced its plans to
suspend XRP trading on Monday – a move that was hardly surprising given
the exchange’s IPO aspirations.

XRP has been in freefall ever since the SEC filed a lawsuit against
Ripple for allegedly violating securities laws. This prompted several
exchanges to delist XRP to avoid regulatory backlash. Ripple says the
lawsuit “has already affected countless innocent XRP retail holders with
no connection to Ripple.”

In the meantime, Ripple will continue to operate and support all its
products outside the U.S. The statement explained: “The majority of our
customers aren’t in the U.S. and overall XRP volume is largely traded
outside of the U.S. There are clear rules of the road for using XRP in
the UK, Japan, Switzerland and Singapore, for example.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse
believes his company will still succeed regardless of how the SEC
chooses to classify XRP. That’s because more than 90% of RippleNet users
are outside the country.

Few within the crypto industry have defended Ripple against the SEC’s
allegations. Coin Center, a D.C.-based think tank and champion for
cryptocurrency adoption, says it isn’t prepared to argue that XRP is not
a security.
