Bitcoin (BTC) returned to hitting records on Dec. 30 after a fresh
rebound took it above its $28,400 all-time high. Data from Cointelegraph
Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD tackle its existing historic top
during trading on Wednesday. In a strong resurgence overnight, Bitcoin
confirmed that it had no time for bears after briefly dipping as low as
$25,830 over the past 24 hours. Daily gains were at 7.5% at press time
as $28,560 became reality.

The move brings Bitcoin ever closer to sealing $30,000 as a new
psychological level before the end of the year, something which seemed
all but impossible just one week ago. As Cointelegraph reported,
however, analysts still believe that a reversal could take the largest
cryptocurrency down to existing support at $19,500.

On Tuesday, Cointelegraph Markets analyst MichaÃ«l van de Poppe
noentheless highlighted $27,500 as the critical area to break in order
to pave the ways for new all-time highs. The knock-on impact among major
cap altcoins was clearly felt, with Ether (ETH) nearing $740 after
rising 5.5% on the day. Polkadot (DOT) added to existing strength to see
weekly performance approach 50%. As before, the exception was XRP, which
maintained 10% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) losses as continued delistings by major exchanges
further weighed on sentiment. The troubled coin nonetheless managed to
reclaim $0.20.
