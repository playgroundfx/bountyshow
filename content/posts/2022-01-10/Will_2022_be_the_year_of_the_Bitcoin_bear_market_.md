The cryptocurrency market received moderate support from retail buyers
over the weekend. Over the past 24 hours, the capitalisation of all
coins rose 0.22%, according to CoinMarketCap, approaching $1.97
trillion. The top altcoins lost 11-19% over 7 days but found buyers over
the weekend. The $2 trillion mark in total crypto valuation turned into
local resistance last week, from where pressure has intensified.
However, a strong buy-the-deep mood has kept the market from forming a
downward spiral.

The cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index was stuck at 23 over the weekend,
indicating extreme fear. The index has been hovering at the lower half
of the scale since November 18th. Optimists, however, may note that the
indicator has bounced back from the 10 level. The dip here in May and
July coincided with the lows within the impulse, hinting at the
potential for some technical rebound.

Technical analysis also suggests a rebound in BTCUSD, with the RSI on
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts showing attempts to move up from the oversold area below 30
and the price hovering near the reversal area in September.

A longer-term view of the cryptocurrency market makes one more cautious
about its prospects. Bitcoin has been in a downward corridor since
November last year, having fallen to its lower boundary by the end of
last week. Local overselling is a chance for a rebound, but the overall
trend is still downwards.

Cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should not dismiss the idea of 4-year cycles in
Bitcoin affecting the entire sector just yet. According to this
hypothesis, 2022 could turn out to be a repeat of 2018 and 2014 â€“ bear
market years after a surge in the previous two years. Thus, it is worth
paying increased attention to whether the crypto market manages to
return to growth in the coming days and weeks. A strong start to the
year will put these fears to rest.
