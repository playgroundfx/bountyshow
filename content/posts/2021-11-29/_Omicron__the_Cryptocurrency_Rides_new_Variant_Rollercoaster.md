LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - As global markets fell last week on [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of
the new Omicron coronavirus variant, one cryptocurrency with the same
name soared after the Greek letter entered the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) lexicon.

The price of the hitherto-obscure digital token, whose Twitter feed has
little more than 1,000 followers, rose almost ten-fold from Friday to
Monday morning when it hit $688, before tumbling as much as 75%, crypto
tracker CoinGecko said.

Omicron the token, which its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) describes as "a decentralized
treasury-backed currency protocol," was trading at about $371 at 1435
GMT. On Thursday it was worth about $65.

The World Health Organization, which on Friday named the new COVID-19
variant Omicron, said as more countries reported cases it carries a
"very high" global risk of surges, although scientists have said it
could take weeks to understand its severity.

Bitcoin suffered its worst day in two months on Friday, dropping by more
than 8% as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s dumped stocks and other riskier assets in favour of
perceived safe havens like the dollar. It has since recovered nearly all
of its losses, with global markets gaining a semblance of calm on
Monday.

From "squid game" to dogecoin, minor cryptocurrencies have this year
benefitted from links to memes or web culture, recording rapid booms and
busts while more mainstream names such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) soar in popularity.

It was not clear when the Omicron token was launched. Data on its price
at CoinGecko was only available from Nov. 8, while a Telegram channel
under the name OmicDAO was launched a day earlier.

Reuters was not able to reach anyone representing Omicron for comment.
