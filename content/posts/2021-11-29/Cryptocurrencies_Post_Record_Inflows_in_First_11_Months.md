NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency products and funds posted
record inflows in the first 11 months of the year, as institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s flocked into the space despite price declines in the last few
weeks, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday.

Total inflows into the sector were $9.5 billion as of Nov. 26, an all-
time high. In 2020, total [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) inflows were $6.7 billion.

On the week, inflows reached $306 million.

Bitcoin saw its largest inflows in five weeks totaling $247 million,
CoinShares data showed, following the launch of another investment
product in Europe.

Invesco has launched a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded product in Europe, media
reports said. CoinDesk meanwhile reported that asset manager WisdomTree
has listed a trio of crypto basket ETPs on Swiss stock exchange SIX and
Frankfurt-based BÃ¶rse Xetra.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has seen inflows for 11 straight
weeks with a total of $2.7 billion, CoinShares said.

Bitcoin's inflows last week came as the price fell by 2.3%, after a
10.4% drop the previous week. On Friday, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) sank nearly 9% as
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s dumped the virtual currency amid fears of the impact of the
new COVID-19 variant Omicron. It was last up 2% at $58,483.

> "Inflation is skyrocketing and people are searching for more
alternatives for their money in the bank," said Ruud Feltkamp, chief of
cloud-based [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) crypto trading bot Cryptohopper.

> "I don't think it'll take long until [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see this as a 'cheap'
buying moment. We are still in the midst of the bull cycle, and I think
rising inflation will lead to more money being allocated to stocks and
crypto," he added.

Ethereum-based products and funds, meanwhile, saw inflows for a fifth
straight week, with $23 million.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of inflows relative to assets under management, Polkadot and
Solana continue to be the winners, with inflows representing 8.6% of
AUM, or $11.5 million, and 5.9% or $14.6 million, respectively, last
week.

CoinShares also announced that it has also been tracking [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
equity ETPs, currently with an AUM of $3.7 billion. These ETPs posted
inflows of $20 million last week, with a year-to-date total of $2
billion.
