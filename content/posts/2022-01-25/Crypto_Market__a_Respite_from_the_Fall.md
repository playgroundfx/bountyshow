The cryptocurrency market is adding 0.2% in the last 24 hours to $1.63
trillion, experiencing some pause or rebound after a prolonged drawdown.
Buyer interest in cryptocurrencies came at the expense of a rebound in
US equities, where selloff hunters thought their time had come.

The cryptocurrency market capitalisation without Bitcoin became less
than 1 trillion last Saturday, and this round level now acts as near-
term resistance.

At one point on Monday, Bitcoin was down to $33K, but at the late US
session, and now trades near $36.4K. Yesterday’s drawdown almost closed
the gap in July and also came from the lower boundary of the downward
channel. The latter indicates that despite the prevalence of bears, the
market is not yet ready to accelerate the decline.

Bitcoin is gaining 2.8% in 24 hours, but most altcoins are losing
ground. So, yesterday’s rebound in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the positive dynamics of
the crypto market are more correctly attributed to technical factors:
crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are exiting altcoins to more liquid BTC, forming
temporary bounces, but nothing more.

The nearest target for BTC downside is $32.3K to close the gap entirely.
However, it is worth being prepared to retest the July lows of
$29.5-30K. Without support from the stock markets, these levels may not
hold for long either.

Ether also saw a bounce yesterday towards the end of the day, making it
clear that the market is far from surrendering. After seven days of
collapse, the primary altcoin managed to close Monday with a tiny gain.
Nevertheless, there are no signs of breaking the downtrend yet.
Moreover, a death cross is also forming over the ether, as the 50-day
moving average is now only a couple of days away from crossing the
200-day from the top down. This signal is often followed by a new
bearish attack.
