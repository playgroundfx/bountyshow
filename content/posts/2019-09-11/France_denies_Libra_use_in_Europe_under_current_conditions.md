So, Bruno Le Maire said to Independent [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)paper on Thursday, he wanted
to sound clear enough, that in those conditions that are now one should
not permit the operation of the Facebook’s Libra in European region due
to a whole list of risks.

Those risks refer to overall financial system, monetary sovereignty and
the concerns over possibility for abuse of market power.

France finance minister gave these comments in the framework of OECD
conference on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and crypto in Paris. One should remind, that a
bit earlier he also expressed his concerns regarding the potential of
Libra becoming a sovereign currency.

  * Bitcoin added 0.27 percent, to $10,133 at 10.22 GMT;

  * Bitcoin Cash tumbled by 0.47 percent, to $295,60;

  * Ethereum gained 0.37 percent, to $177.59;
