BitMEX announced an ether quarterly futures product Friday, which it
described as “the only one of its kind available in the market.” Settled
in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the contract trades the ether-dollar pair, and expiry is in
June. This coincides with the scheduled ETH 2.0 launch in July, which
Ethereum researchers are confident will happen, as CoinDesk previously
reported.

Long positions in Bitfinex ether perpetual futures are also soaring
ahead of the Ethereum upgrade. Those contracts began noticeably climbing
starting in mid-March, just after the price of ether crashed to a little
above $100.

While quarterly futures have contract dates four times per year,
perpetual futures trade without expiration dates. This gives traders
some of the advantages of the futures markets such as high leverage
while mimicking the price behavior of the spot market.

Open interest for ether futures on Bitfinex is at just over $500,000 at
the time of publication, while open interest on BitMEX, the largest
market for ether perpetual futures, is just below $80 million, according
to data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) CoinGecko. Bitfinex traders taking more long
positions in ether futures could signal speculative bullishness ahead of
the ETH 2.0 launch in addition to hedging strategies or an [arbitrage](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/arbitrage-bot-bitcoin/)
trade incentivized by funding rates.

Cryptocurrency over-the-counter desks are also seeing increased [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
demand for ether after recent March lows and heading into the scheduled
ETH 2.0 launch.

Traders might be more bullish than other sectors in the Ethereum
community, however. After previous delays in launching the ETH 2.0
mainnet, some of the Ethereum community is more “cautiously optimistic”
as the July launch date approaches, said Wilson Withiam, Ethereum
analyst at Messari.

The ETH 2.0 mainnet launch has “too many variables that developers can’t
account for at the moment,” Withiam told CoinDesk. But the community is
generally enthusiastic about staking ether, and if the launch was
delayed again, it “shouldn’t mute the community’s enthusiasm for
staking,” said Withiam. After mainnet launches, short-term returns for
cryptocurrencies are largely negative, according to research from
Messari. The price of ether was up less than 1 percent on Sunday at $195
at the time of publication, according to Bitstamp.
