On Tuesday, the dollar added around 0.5% to a basket of the six most
popular currencies on turbulence in some market sectors. The “buy
rumours, sell facts” model played out in full force yesterday and may
continue to dominate the markets for quite some time.

Bitcoin has officially become legal tender in El Salvador. Both media
and social media have spurred interest in the event in recent weeks. The
price reaching the $53k area triggered big profit-taking, which quickly
escalated into a margin call that pushed the price back to $10k at one
point.

Bitcoin is profoundly entwined with the financial system, so its
volatility affected the overall demand for risk.

There was a telling sell-off in precious metals, where gold lost about
1.5% to $1800, while silver and platinum fell over 2%, to $24.2 and
$1000, respectively. These metals were pushed back to critical technical
levels, once again raising the question that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are ready to
switch to long position liquidation mode very quickly.

This was also reflected in the Wall Streets Fear Gauge, the VIX, which
jumped 15.7% on Tuesday. Remarkably, the local lows of the index have
been increasingly higher since July, which means that the lull in the
markets is becoming less and less calm.

The drop in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and gold and the jump in the VIX points to increased
nervousness in the markets. In such an environment, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s often
perceive a relatively neutral [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) backdrop as an excuse to tread
carefully to lock in profits. However, the dynamics of the same Bitcoin
clearly show how quickly the market can move from this phase to margin
calls, when a broad pull into the most liquid and defensive securities
is formed, triggering strong demand for the dollar.

Historically, September is considered the worst month for the stock
market, as funds and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s often lock in profits towards the end of
the US financial year. And we already see a clear manifestation of this
traction in instruments sensitive to the pull into risky assets.
