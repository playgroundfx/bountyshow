TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin licked its wounds on Wednesday, a day after
its heaviest losses in 2-1/2 months as El Salvador’s historic adoption
of the crypto asset as legal tender caused chaos online and on the
street.

The coin last traded at $46,560, having endured wild trade the day
before in which it hit a near four-month high of $52,956 before plunging
11.1%, its largest fall since June 2.

Analysts said the sharp retreat was partly due to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who had
bought the rumour of El Salvador’s move now selling the fact.

> “I think there was some anticipation building ahead of that event (El
Salvador), similar to what we saw ahead of Coinbase listing on Nasdaq,”
said Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer at Apollo Capital, a
crypto asset fund in Melbourne, Australia.

At one point on Tuesday, the digital currency fell as much as 18.6%,
wiping out more than $180 billion from the market.

It was a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) day for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as El Salvador’s experiment of
making it legal tender got off to a bumpy start.

Technological glitches hampered its use while street protests by
mistrustful citizens broke out in the Central American country.

As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) wobbled, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said his
government purchased an additional 150 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s on Tuesday, worth around
$7 million.

> “That has underscored the difficulty in trying to protect the value of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as its own currency,” said Nana Otsuki, chief economist at Monex
Securities. “The buying didn’t seem to be effective in halting its
fall.”

Amid the trading frenzy, major U.S. [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s Coinbase
Global Inc, Kraken and Gemini struggled with delays in some
transactions. All of them said their systems have since been restored.

Separately, the U.S. securities regulator has threatened to sue Coinbase
Global if the crypto exchange proceeds with plans to launch a programme
allowing users to earn interest by lending crypto assets.
