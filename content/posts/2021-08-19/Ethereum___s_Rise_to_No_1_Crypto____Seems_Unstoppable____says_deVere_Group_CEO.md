![Ethereum’s rise to No.1 crypto ‘seems unstoppable’ says deVere Group
CEO][1]

The CEO and founder of one of the world’s largest independent financial
[advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y organizations, the deVere Group, has stated that Ethereum’s
price appreciation should continue to beat Bitcoin’s in 2021. The deVere
Group chief executive Nigel Green also believes that Ethereum’s value
will exceed that of Bitcoin’s within a few short years.

> “Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin and it can be expected to continue
this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said. Ethereum has gained more than
300% so far this year whereas the world’s most popular digital asset is
up 55% by comparison. “In fact, it has outperformed all other benchmark
assets in the first half of this year,” added Green according to City
AM.

The respected analyst attributed two key factors to Ethereum’s stellar
performance in 2021. Ethereum has a higher level of real-use potential
and is the most in-demand development platform for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s he
said, “thereby highlighting that network’s value not only as a platform
for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,”

Secondly, Green commented that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) enthusiasm for the “game-
changing” transition to ETH 2.0 represents a major boost not just for
Ethereum, but for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology itself. “Ultimately, this will
mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin — probably within five
years,”

The company executive isn’t bearish on Bitcoin however and remains
confident that Bitcoin will hit, or even surpass, its mid-April all-time
high of $65,000 by the end of 2021.
