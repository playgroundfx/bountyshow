![Bitcoin volatility will drive [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s back to gold, says mining firm
chairman][1]

Wild swings in cryptocurrencies will eventually drive [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to return to gold, says the executive chairman of gold mining firm
Evolution Mining. Jake Klein said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) still has a “long way to go”
before it demonstrates the kind of “longevity and security” that gold
has proven to offer [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s over the last 70 years.

Cryptocurrencies are “running a massive amount of speculative money,” he
told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Thursday. “I think that the volatility
in the crypto space is going to ultimately lead to people coming back to
gold,” Klein said.

Gold prices fell last week, and analysts say they will likely drop
further. Hedge fund manager David Neuhauser told CNBC earlier this week
that the decline in gold prices is a “massive buying opportunity” for
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s now. Still, Klein said the two can coexist — there are
opportunities for gold to “sit alongside” [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), as opposed to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
posing a threat to the precious metal.

Bullish [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s view [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as digital gold and a hedge against
inflation, expecting the cryptocurrency to appreciate over time.
American [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Tyler Winklevoss, who founded Winklevoss Capital
Management as well as Gemini [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/), said last year
that “[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is gold 2.0” — and that it will disrupt gold. Billionaire
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Kevin O’Leary said in April that “[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will always be the
‘gold.’ Ethereum will always be the ‘silver.’”
