Bitcoin has been slowly declining and is trading around $44K on the
penultimate day of the week. Technical analysis showed us that the first
cryptocurrency’s inability to confidently overcome $48K would result in
a correction. Nevertheless, the correction remains moderate at this
stage.

Apparently, large institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are focused on the traditional
market. The publication of the FOMC minutes triggered a liquidation of
risky assets but so far only marginally affected the crypto market. The
benchmark S&P 500 stock index is declining, which could be followed by
the crypto market.

Trading volumes on the Bitcoin network remain depressed, suggesting a
wait-and-see attitude remains in place. In theory, the current
uncertainty in digital assets and low trading volumes are a great
opportunity for a small market to profit very quickly from increased
market volatility.

Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the crypto market at the current
stage, but there is an opinion that it may concede its role to Ethereum.
Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, believes that the price of ETH could
overtake BTC in a few years.

Already, many crypto exchanges are claiming that Ethereum is ahead of
Bitcoin in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trading volumes. Indeed, the project boasts of
delivering on its promises, and although the deadlines are regularly
postponed, this is perceived positively in the community, pointing to a
desire to minimize bugs. Ethereum has more substantial real-world
potential, and it is also the basis for a huge number of projects,
including DeFi and Stablecoin.

The Dogecoin Foundation, whose leadership includes Vitaly Buterin and
Neuralink CEO Jared Birchall (= Elon Musk), may be an interesting [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
factor. Apparently, having “probed” the prospects of the price dynamics
of this cryptocurrency joke, it was decided to continue development.

As always, it is a matter of a combination of factors that attracted
famous names to the project, and now the demand for the coin may reach a
whole new level. It is very likely that the motto “DOGE = $1” may well
become a reality.

The end of the summer lull could intensify the fluctuations of the
crypto market. As the borders begin to open and as a relatively
successful vaccination campaign is underway, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have gone on
vacation. From the looks of it, their return will be immediately
noticeable by the increase in trading volumes. It is likely that as big
capital returns to work, we could be in for hot autumn and an equally
hot winter.
