![Draft El Salvador Bitcoin banking [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s released][1]

The central bank of El Salvador, Banco Central de Reserva (BCR), has
published draft [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s on how banks should handle Bitcoin. Two
documents were released for consultation on Aug. 17 instructing banks
and financial institutions [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) offer Bitcoin-related services to
their customers. The first, titled “Guidelines for the Authorization of
Operation of the Digital Wallet Platform for Bitcoin and Dollars” (in
Spanish), defines BTC as legal tender according to the recently drafted
Bitcoin Law which was passed by El Salvador’s legislature on June 9 and
will see the country formally adopt the digital asset on September 7.

The second document titled “Technical Standards to Facilitate the
Application of the Bitcoin Law” is a longer and more detailed version of
the first document. Financial entities must apply to the central bank to
offer digital wallets, the guidelines stated. Applications must detail
the type of product being offered, and include target market details,
risk assessments, charges to customers, education provisions for
customers, and complaint procedures.

Know-your-customer (KYC) verification will be required for all customers
though it was unclear whether the national ID card, which is used for
basic bank accounts, would suffice for a [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/). Full anti-money
laundering (AML) procedures such as transaction monitoring and analysis
would also be applied.

Article 29 of the second document requires the bank or financial
institution to warn customers that Bitcoin is volatile, transactions
cannot be reversed, and that if they lose their private keys, then they
lose the BTC. There were no provisions for accounting standards or
standard government exchange rates for converting Bitcoin into fiat and
vice versa.

On August 16, American credit rating agency Fitch Ratings stated that
the BTC adoption plan will likely be a credit negative for local
insurance companies due to volatility and risk concerns.
