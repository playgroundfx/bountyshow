A report on Friday from Ethereum metrics [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Dune Analytics showed
that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem now counts over 1
million unique Ethereum addresses as participants — an over tenfold
increase from the 91,000 addresses on Dec. 6, 2019.

Adoption?][1]

But while the growth has been undeniable, some experts caution not to
interpret the milestone as a sign of widespread adoption. In fact, in
order for DeFi to truly break mainstream, many of the emerging
vertical’s proponents may have to rethink their communication and
outreach strategies.

The Dune Analytics report, compiled by aggregating the total number of
addresses which have ever utilized popular DeFi protocols such as
Uniswap, Compound, and Aave, noted that their calculations interpret
“users” as “unique addresses,” meaning that the millionth address mark
might not be as bullish as it seems at first blush.

Many DeFi users commonly deploy multiple addresses in order to protect
their privacy while transacting on Ethereum’s public network, and
conflating “addresses” with “users” may lead analysts to some dubious
figures.

Brian Flynn, the co-founder of a startup that helps to incentivize
participation in DeFi, Rabbithole, suggests that the actual number of
participants is far lower.

> “The reality is that the number of unique users is only 10-15% of
that. That’s the real metric that matters,” Flynn told Cointelegraph.

‘Speculators to participants’  
So how will DeFi truly reach a million users and beyond? Flynn explained
that the first step in attracting a larger number of unique users will
be a “killer application focused around speculation” similar to CeFi
trading platform Robinhood, which enjoyed a remarkable boom in
participation during the Covid lockdowns.

Over the long term, however, finding ways to incentivize users to
participate in governance and infrastructure-layer elements of DeFi is
what will lead to sustainable success.
