The sharp revenue increase came as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) soared through November,
setting a new all-time high by month’s end after gaining over 40
percent. Monthly aggregate revenue in November hit the highest level
since September 2019. Revenue estimates assume miners sell their BTC
immediately.

Measured by revenue per terahash (TH), the unit measurement for the
speed of cryptocurrency mining hardware, miner revenue hit six-month
highs as it climbed above $0.15 multiple times in November, the highest
level since early May, according to data aggregated by mining software
company Luxor Technologies.

Despite significant intra-year volatility, mining revenue measured by
terahash per second (TH/s) is roughly flat year to date from roughly
$0.138 per TH/s on Jan 1 to $0.135 per TH/s at last check.

Network fees brought in $54.9 million in November, or nearly 11% total
revenue, a slight percentage decrease from the 12.2% of revenue
represented by fees in October.

Fees steadily declined through November, coming down from the roughly
two-year highs in late October, dropping from a $13 average transaction
fee at the start of November to below $3 near month’s end, per Coin
Metrics.

Notably, fees as a percentage of total revenue continues a strong upward
trend since April, prior to the network’s third-ever block subsidy
halving in May. Increases in fee revenue are important to sustain the
network’s security as the subsidy decreases every four years.
