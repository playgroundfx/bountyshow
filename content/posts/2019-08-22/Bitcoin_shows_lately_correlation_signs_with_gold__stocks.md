tight relationship with other assets during the last 90 days in
connection to gold and stocks in a whole.

As it follows from a Digital Asset Data report one can see that over the
past three months, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was moving approximately in lockstep with
gold, but with an inverted move regarding the stock market.

The last one move of inverted correlation could be seen on the example
of the Wednesday’s trading, when the world’s No.1 cryptocurrency dived,
whereas U.S.stocks showed a positive dynamics with an approximate jump
of 1 percent.

The direct correlation was marked in reference to yellow metal, which
was moving in the last 90 days in the same direction. Certainly, this
emerged correlation could be viewed as a statistically significant, but
still it  suggests the idea, that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) begins to be considered
alongside with safe-haven asset, gold, so, to crown it all the most
known cryptocurrency could be perceived as an alternative to usual
securities.

Meanwhile it should be pointed out the Thursday’s cryptocurrency rates:
Bitcoin remains negative, with a  1.55 percent slump, at $10.005 at
12.29 GMT, by the way, Gold price tumbled by 0.72 percent, to $1.504.90.
