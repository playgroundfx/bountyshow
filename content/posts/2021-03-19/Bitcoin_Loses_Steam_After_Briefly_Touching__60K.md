Bitcoin’s (BTC) price slid Thursday, retreating along with U.S. stocks
and oil prices as U.S. Treasury yields touched some of the highest
levels in a year. The 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, breached 1.75% for the first time
since January 2020. The rising yield has been seen by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as a
sign of market worries over future inflation.

“Should [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) remain above this level, then the bulls will feel happy
exploring and pushing prices to the upside, with $60,780 the target.” A
break lower could see the market trade down to as low as $53,360, he
wrote.

The Japanese brokerage Mizuho recently estimated that some $40 billion
of the latest round of direct $1,400 stimulus checks from the U.S.
government might be spent on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and stocks. The German lender
Deutsche Bank published a report this week stating that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is “now
too important to ignore” given its $1 trillion market capitalization.
