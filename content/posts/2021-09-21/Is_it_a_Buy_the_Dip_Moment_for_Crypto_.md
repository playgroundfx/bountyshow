On Monday, Bitcoin lost up to 10%, dropping at some point to $42.4K.
This happened against the backdrop of selling pressure on global stock
exchanges. Early on Tuesday morning, an avalanche of stop orders had
already driven the price to $40.2K and back. These are the lows since
the beginning of August. If the market repeats the May correction, it
might not be over on the RSI yet.

At the same time, it cannot be said that the situation is now completely
out of the control of the bulls. The losses of major cryptocurrencies do
not exceed 10%, and buyers have clearly appeared in the markets. It is
difficult to say now how strong the support will be at current levels.

With the arrival of European capital markets on Tuesday, buyers were
clearly activated, which allowed Bitcoin to regain its fall from the
beginning of the day and gives a chance to fight for a close in the
green zone. The cryptocurrency index of fear and greed has now dropped
into the fear area at the level of 27, losing 23 points in a day. These
are the lows since July 24, when downturn buying intensified in the
market.

Bitcoin traders should keep their eye on the $45K level. The ability to
quickly recover and go above this mark will indicate the beginning of
purchases in the downturn. Anchoring below this line for a week could
trigger a significant surrender of bullish crypto enthusiasts.

The BTC chart is now below the 200 [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) MA ($45K) and has already
tested the area under the 21-week MA at $42K with a candle shadow. Both
lines are formal signs of a bull market if the chart is above them.
Maintaining the second level of support is an extremely important factor
in preserving the prospects for further growth.

Many analysts have named the fall in shares of the Chinese developer
China Evergrande Group and the sharp drop in the S&P500 as the reasons
for yesterday’s collapse of the crypto market. However, for the price to
rise, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s need to start buying. At the same time, the dynamics of
altcoins and trading volumes before and after yesterday’s fall show that
crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue to buy coins.

If we consider specifically the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the experimental corporate
use of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in companies in Laos, then the market reacted to this
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) with extreme restraint. Instead, it didn’t even take them into
account. Laos maintains a strong economic and political relationship
with China. The PRC, as we know, is categorically against any
legalization of cryptocurrencies. Investors understand this and do not
believe that Bitcoin can get widespread circulation in this Republic.
Still, they are unlikely to want to spoil relations with a key partner
in Laos.

Yesterday, as is typical for them, cryptocurrencies lost value with two
or three times the amplitude against the background of a decline in US
indices. The downgrade had such a large scale, not necessarily because
of the strength of the mentioned [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), but because of the lack of
liquidity during the holidays in China and Japan. This created an
increased demand for liquidity among institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which led
to much more pressure than the situation deserved.

On Tuesday morning, the downtrend continued solely due to the automatic
triggering of stop orders for long positions.

A positive factor that should be considered is that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and altcoins
have been decreasing approximately the same over the last 24 hours.
Usually, during serious sales, small coins lose many times more than
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
