NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency investment products and funds saw
inflows for a fifth consecutive week as market sentiment on the sector
continued to improve, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed
on Monday.

Crypto inflows amounted to $41.6 million for the week ended Sept. 17,
with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) getting the bulk of inflows at $15.3 million, and ether
products garnering $6.6 million. The data showed that inflows were seen
across the board.

Digital currency inflows for 2021 were a still a robust $5.96 billion.

> “This improved sentiment could be a seasonal phenomenon, but we are
not seeing a commensurate rise in volumes in investment products,” said
James Butterfill, investment strategist, at CoinShares.

> “This suggests that some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are taking advantage of recent
price weakness and the continued rise in alt-coin popularity,” he added.

Bitcoin has suffered the most from negative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment with
inflows in only three of the last 16 weeks, the report said. Over the
course of this year, its total market share of assets under management
has fallen from 81% in January to just 67% as of last Friday, it added.

Overall, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) inflows for the year amounted to $4.2 billion.

Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest note on Monday,
acknowledged the current macroeconomic backdrop that featured growing
uncertainties in Chinese credit markets. But it noted that even amid
this landscape, “[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price action, and on-chain [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) responses
appear relatively robust.”

Glassnode believes [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is forming a “consolidation trading range.”

Bitcoin hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6, but was
currently down 7.4% at $43,748.

Grayscale is still the largest crypto asset manager, with $43.2 billion
in AUM, up from about $28.5 billion around mid- to early August.

AUM at CoinShares, the second biggest digital asset manager, were at
$4.2 billion.
