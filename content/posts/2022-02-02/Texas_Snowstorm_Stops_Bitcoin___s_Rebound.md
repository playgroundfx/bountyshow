Bitcoin fell 4.8% on Wednesday, ending the day around $37.0K. Ethereum
lost 3.9%, while other top-ten altcoins fell between 4.4% (Cardano and
Polkadot) and 7.8% (Solana and Terra).

The total capitalisation of the crypto market, according to CoinGecko,
overnight fell by 3.4% to $1.8 trillion, while Bitcoin’s dominance index
fell 0.2% to 39.2%.

Bitcoin began a sharp decline on Wednesday as the US session opened,
along with US stock index futures. After several hours of falling, stock
indices reversed and regained momentum. BTC, meanwhile, broke its
previous strong correlation with equity indices and did not show a
meaningful rebound.

The benchmark cryptocurrency came under pressure from reports of a
severe snowstorm coming to Texas. A year ago, a similar weather anomaly
disrupted the power supply to a quarter of households and caused loss of
life, forcing authorities to impose a state of emergency.

The state’s association of miners, the Texas Blockchain Council, decided
to de-energise mining farms on Wednesday.

Texas is home to the main [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network computing capacity in the US.
The states themselves are the world’s number one miner of the
significant digital asset (around 49% of hash rate).

Bitcoin again proved that it remains in a downward channel, as the
recovery bounce lost strength at the upper end of the range. In theory,
a bearish reversal of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) opens the possibility of updating the
January lows with potential targets near 30K.
