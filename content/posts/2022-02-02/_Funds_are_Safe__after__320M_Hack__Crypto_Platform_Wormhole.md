* _More than $320 million of tokens stolen_
  * _Hack is fourth-biggest ever crypto theft_
  * _Wormhole says on Telegram channel "all funds are safe"_
  * _DeFi sites increasingly targeted by criminals_

Feb 3 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency platform Wormhole said on Thursday that
"all funds are safe" after hackers stole more than $320 million from its
site in the fourth-largest crypto heist on record.

Wormhole, which allows the transfer of information from one crypto
network to another, said on Twitter on Wednesday that it was "exploited"
for 120,000 units of a version of the second-largest cryptocurrency,
ether. At the time of the announcement, the market value of the tokens
totalled just over $320 million.

The theft was the latest to shake the fast-growing but mostly
unregulated decentralised finance (DeFi) sites, which allow users to
lend, borrow and save - usually in cryptocurrencies - while bypassing
traditional gatekeepers of finance such as banks.

Wormhole said in a further tweet early on Thursday that "the
vulnerability has been patched" and it was working to get the network
back up. A message on Wormhole's Telegram channel later said: "A fix has
been deployed and all funds are safe," without giving further details.

Wormhole did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment via
social media. Like many DeFi sites, Wormhole gives few details of its
location or structure.

London-based [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analysis firm Elliptic said that attackers were
able to [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulently create the wETH tokens, almost 94,000 of which were
later transferred to the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), which powers transactions
for ether.

Elliptic added that Wormhole has offered the attacker a $10 million
"bounty" to return the funds, citing messages embedded within ether
transactions sent to the attacker's digital address.

MAJOR HACKING RISK

Cash has poured into DeFi sites, mirroring the explosion of interest in
cryptocurrencies as a whole. Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, facing [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low or
sub-zero interest rates, are drawn to DeFi by the promise of high
returns on savings.

Yet with their breakneck growth, DeFi platforms have emerged as a major
hacking risk, with bugs in code and design flaws allowing criminals to
target DeFi sites and deep pools of liquidity, and also to launder the
proceeds of crime, while leaving few traces.

Fraud and theft at DeFi platforms surpassed $10 billion last year,
research by Elliptic shows, laying bare the risks in the fast-growing
but mostly unregulated area of cryptocurrencies.

Last August, hackers behind likely the biggest ever digital coin heist
returned nearly all of the $610 million-plus they stole from the DeFi
site Poly Network.

Hacks have long plagued crypto platforms. In 2018, digital tokens worth
some $530 million were stolen from Tokyo-based platform Coincheck. Mt.
Gox, another Japanese exchange, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole
half a billion dollars of crypto.
