The crypto market remains in limbo and resembles a compressed spring at
the same time. Bitcoin is trading slightly below $46,000 on Tuesday
morning, ending the sluggish slide of the previous six days.

Strictly speaking, the cryptocurrency market does not look over-sold to
be unequivocally attractive for short- and medium-term buying, but it
does show signs of buyer interest.

The Cryptocurrency Greed and Fear Index has fallen to the 30, i.e.,
“Fear”. From these levels, the index began the most active sell-off
phase of the crypto market in May. Historically, buying cryptocurrencies
was most attractive when the index reversed to a rise from around 10
(with extreme fear).

However, caution is not yet a vital trait for crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Bitcoin
has been methodically gaining support this month on the downside of a
simple 200-day moving average, which now passes near $44300. In early
August, the rise from this curve has kick-started a 40% rise over the
next five weeks.

Yesterday’s Litecoin momentum illustrates just how fast and strong the
move can be on big [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

Yesterday, a moment of euphoria was experienced by Litecoin, whose
quotations soared by a third to $235 on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that Walmart would
accept the coin as payment. The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) turned fake, and the coin quickly
returned to previous levels near $173. However, the positive momentum in
the coin is worth noting, which has been steadily finding buy support on
dips below $170 over the past week, stuck between the 50- and 200-day
moving averages.

In recent days, altcoins have generally looked weaker than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
allowing the latter to regain some of its lost ground in the overall
crypto market capitalisation. And that’s not such a bad sign, as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
is often the first to see a change in trend. The presence of steady
buying in the coming days will allow markets to shake off pessimistic
expectations from the crypto market and revive positive price momentum
amid a protracted lull after the downturn.
