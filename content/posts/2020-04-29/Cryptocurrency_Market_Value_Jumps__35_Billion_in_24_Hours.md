Cryptocurrency prices surged on Thursday, led by a big jump in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
The entire market capitalization or value of cryptocurrencies jumped
$35.3 billion in 24 hours as of 2.19 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from CoinMarketCap.com.

Bitcoin, which accounts for most of that movement, was at $9,388.30 — or
up 18.57% in the last 24 hours as of 2.03 p.m. Singapore time, Coindesk
data showed. That’s the highest level since March 7.

Cryptocurrencies saw two major bouts of selling in March amid the
broader plunge in equity markets. But they have now recovered that
ground. Industry participants attribute this to two factors — central
bank monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as well as an upcoming event known as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
halving.

well, as a result of the new money printing”, Vijay Ayyar, head of
