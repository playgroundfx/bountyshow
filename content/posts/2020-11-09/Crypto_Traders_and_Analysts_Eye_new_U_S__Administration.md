While some in the community continue to question the outcome of the US
Presidential election, mainstream media outlets and the Associated Press
have definitively called the race for former Vice President and current
President-Elect Joe Biden. But with uncertainty out of the way, traders
and analysts are now looking to determine what a Biden administration
will mean for cryptocurrencies — and they appear to have come to a loose
consensus that a President who says nothing about crypto is preferable
to a president who actively disparages it.

Qiao Wang, the lead at decentralized finance accelerator DeFi Alliance,
cheered Trump’s loss, noting that the President had tweeted negatively
about Bitcoin and Libra in the past: The fact that Trump and Mnuchin are
hostile towards BTC makes a Trump a far inferior candidate. Full stop.
However the senate part is debatable. You could argue that democrats are
more likely to create inflation which is good for BTC. Meanwhile,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Mike Novogratz concurred that a Democratic administration would
be good for crypto, saying that an ongoing stimulus program would
bolster Bitcoin’s anti-inflationary narrative:

At a macro level, Cointelegraph has previously reported that an incoming
Biden administration may bolster markets as uncertainty settles and
hopes for additional stimulus run high, but likewise these efforts could
cripple cryptocurrencies via a stronger dollar. There has also been
widespread speculation concerning the crypto inclinations of key
appointees in the forthcoming administration. Compound general counsel
Jake Chervinsky noted that whoever President-Elect Biden nominates to
posts will be more important than incoming President’s personal
opinions:

President-elect Biden hasn’t said anything publicly about his views on
crypto. For now, it really isn’t a big enough issue to warrant his
attention. The next four years of US crypto [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) depends on who he
appoints to key positions; we’ll know more as the transition gets going.

To that end, Politico first reported that former CFTC chairman and Obama
appointee Gary Gensler, best known for his hardline enforcement of Wall
Street [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, would be a
part of Biden’s transition team. Gensler has spoken positively about
Bitcoin in the past.
