ISTANBUL, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Turkey's Financial Crimes Investigation
Board (MASAK) imposed an 8 million lira ($751,314) fine on the local
unit of [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Binance over violations found during
liability inspections, the Anadolu [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) agency said on Saturday.

The fine imposed on BN Teknoloji was the first of its kind after the
authority took on responsibilities to oversee crypto asset service
providers in May, the state-owned [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) agency said, without elaborating
on the violations or inspections.

A Binance spokesperson said the company did not discuss publicly its
communications with the authorities and regulators. MASAK could not be
reached for comment at the weekend.
