DUBAI, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Binance has received in-principle approval
from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) to become a crypto-asset service
provider in the kingdom, the company said on Monday.

Binance, the world's biggest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) by trading volume,
said the in-principle approval came after the company applied for a
licence from the CBB as part of its plans to become a fully regulated
centralised [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/).

Binance still had to complete the full application process, the company
said in a statement, which it said it expected to happen in due course.
