The rebound of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) began along with the growth of European stock
indices at the beginning of the day. They corrected up after three days
of decline on the crisis around Ukraine. Futures for the S&P 500 and
Nasdaq, with which BTC has been highly correlated lately, also showed
gains on Tuesday.

So far, the rebound of risky assets, which includes cryptocurrencies,
can be considered as a movement within a downtrend. Bitcoin has been
trying to correct from levels close to the lows of February, but this is
probably not the bottom yet.

Expectations of a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and rising
geopolitical tensions are putting pressure on all risky assets. Despite
the rather low levels of the Cryptocurrency Fear Index, the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of
the indicator suggests that the best moments to enter were periods of
falling into the 10 area.

Meanwhile, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, one of the richest Mexican
billionaires, called for not selling [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) during the fall. In his
opinion, BTC will rise in the long term.

Overall, Bitcoin is up 3.6% over the past day to $38,100, closing
Tuesday higher after five days of decline. Ethereum gained 6.1% over the
same time period, while other leading altcoins from the top ten showed
mixed dynamics: from 4% growth in XRP to 13% in Terra.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to CoinGecko,
decreased by 1.5% over the day to $1.79 trillion. Altcoins grew worse
than the first cryptocurrency, which led to an increase in the Bitcoin
dominance index by 0.4%, to 40.3%.

The index of fear and greed turned back again, losing 5 points to 25 and
remaining in a state of “extreme fear”.
