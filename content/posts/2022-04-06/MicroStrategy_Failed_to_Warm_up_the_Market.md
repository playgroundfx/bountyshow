Bitcoin was down 1% on Tuesday, ending the day at around $45.8K. In low-
liquid trading at the start of the day on Wednesday, the first
cryptocurrency was losing more than 3.5%, briefly dropping to $44.4K,
now stabilizing 1k higher. From the levels exactly a day ago, Ethereum
lost 4.4%, among other altcoins, the decline prevails, with the
exception of a few big names. Terra adds 0.6%, staying close to its
highs. Dogecoin is up 7.5%.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, sank by 3.6% over the day, to $2.09 trillion. The Bitcoin
Dominance Index rose 0.2% to 41.2%. The cryptocurrency index of fear and
greed by Wednesday morning lost 5 points to 48 while remaining in a
neutral state.

Bitcoin has continued to correct on Tuesday amid a decline in US stock
indices. Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday morning, we saw the
triggering of algorithmic stop orders, which quickly sent the price
down. However, very soon market participants returned to cautious
purchases. Since the beginning of the month, the bulls have clearly not
been able to develop an offensive, and we see the predominance of
selling on growth towards $47K. On the other hand, support around the
$44,000 level is still in place.

Software developer MicroStrategy bought 4,167 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s on credit for
$190 million. The company currently owns 129.2 thousand BTC worth almost
$4 billion. last days. The fact that even such a large buyer failed to
warm up the market makes us look to the near future with caution.

Bloomberg believes that a rally in the current environment is unlikely.
The market is entering a bearish phase similar to that of the spring of
2019. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz also believes that BTC will be
under pressure from the US Federal Reserve to raise rates this year.

Today, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will make her first speech on
cryptocurrencies. Her presentation will focus on [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
protection. Yellen has previously criticized digital currencies for
their anonymous nature of transactions. The US government has previously
indicated that it wants to see cryptocurrencies private but not
anonymous.

This is similar to the current principles of the banking system, where
the government knows the owners and has the ability by law to seize or
restrict access to assets, but these data are generally not disclosed
publicly.
