On Thursday, PayPal’s crypto trading and payments went live for all
eligible customers in the United States. Per its updated announcement,
PayPal ended its waitlist for customers looking to use cryptocurrency in
the U.S. Trading features a limit of $20,000 per week, which is double
the originally announced $10,000.

PayPal ultimately plans to make crypto payments available at 26 million
merchants globally. A representative told Cointelegraph that PayPal will
notify U.S. customers about the general availability of crypto services
in the coming days.

Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, noted that the shift to supporting crypto
was driven by what he sees as an “inevitable” drift toward virtual
currencies.

> “The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with
it clear advantages in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of financial inclusion and access;
efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability
for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly.” Much-anticipated
global services are expected to launch at the beginning of 2021,
alongside crypto payments on Venmo. PayPal initially announced its plans
to integrate crypto three weeks ago. The announcement led to a boost in
BTC price.

Many noted that the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of PayPal’s crypto services would entail that
coins bought on the platform would not be able to leave, likely as part
of its compromise with regulators in bringing crypto services to such a
wide user base.
