LONDON (Reuters) - Tags for identifying [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) and other
crypto assets will be launched in September in the latest sign of how
the fast growing, unregulated market is adopting the hallmarks of
mainstream investing.

The ability to monitor cryptocurrencies has become a major worry for
regulators as the ballooning market, which reached a record $2 trillion
capitalization in April, has experienced wild volatility and central
bank warnings that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could lose their shirts.

Individual stock and derivatives are already assigned a unique
identification number to allow regulators and market participants to
identify, track and quantify risks from trades.

The new digital token identifiers or DTIs will be registered at the DTI
Foundation, a not-for-profit unit of Etrading Software, a fintech
company that provides market infrastructure.

As the crypto assets sector grows in size, regulators and the market
will need identifiers to track it better, Sassan Danesh, managing
partner at Etrading Software, told Reuters.

DTIs will create a bridge between traditional securities and the new
tokenised world, using norms from the global International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) that are set to be finalised by the end of
September.

At that time the DTI registry will formally issue identifiers for the
100 most important crypto assets and tokens which represent more than
80% of the current crypto market and include [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/), Dogecoin
and Ripple, Danesh said.

Identifiers will also make it easier to compare which exchanges offer
the best prices for specific crypto assets, he added.

ISO based identifiers are already used for reporting securities and
derivatives trades to regulators for spotting market abuses and build up
of risks, and Danesh expects DTIs will lead to a similar requirement for
crypto transactions.

> “We absolutely see there will be regulatory mandate for reporting of
digital assets and that’s driven by just the size of the digital market,
which now cannot be ignored by regulators,” Danesh said.

Given the time needed for the DTIs to be embedded in markets, the end of
2023 would probably be the earliest practical date for introducing
mandatory reporting, he added.

The IT systems of big [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s already reference ISO based identifiers
and adding DTIs would mean no major reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)tion, making it easier to
add digital assets.

> “The financial institutions when they are looking to add digital
assets to the scope of assets classes that they are willing to trade,
the compliance officer doesn’t want to come up with entirely new
policies,” Danesh said.

>

> “That is where the DTI fits in, it’s part of the same family of ISO
standards.”
