![Bitcoin Stalls Near $50K Ahead of Options Expiration Date][1]

Bitcoin stalled after approaching the $50,000 resistance level on
Monday. The cryptocurrency was trading at about $49,500 at press time
and is up about 8% over the past week. Analysts expect a period of
consolidation ahead of Friday’s option expiration date and [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the
Federal Reserve’s annual economic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
“The trend is bullish; however, caution is to be exercised at these
levels due to the decline in volume as well as resistance from April and
May,” Marcus Sotiriou, a trader at GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to
CoinDesk.

> “$51K would be a natural place for a short-term pause in the rally,”
Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a
Monday [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter. “Long-term momentum behind [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has strengthened
and the 200-day (40-week) moving average is rising again, supporting a
bullish long-term outlook,” she wrote. Several analysts noted that
extreme overbought conditions have unwound since April, which is
providing support for the crypto rally.

> “Right now, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptos have enjoyed technical support
(as they were becoming mildly oversold),” Santiago Espinosa, a
strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “At this
juncture, some cryptos can continue to do well if [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers neglect
inflationary pressures and regulatory issues don’t become a mainstream
problem.”

Roughly 25% of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) open interest is set to expire on Friday.
The largest concentration of open interest is seen at the $50,000 strike
price, which is also a key technical resistance level.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market is placing a 45% chance of BTC trading above
$50,000 by the end of September, according to [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) data provider,
Skew. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone, who won plaudits last year
for being among the most prominent analysts predicting that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
would go to $50,000, sees further upside now that the largest
cryptocurrency has returned to the mark following a steep market
correction.
