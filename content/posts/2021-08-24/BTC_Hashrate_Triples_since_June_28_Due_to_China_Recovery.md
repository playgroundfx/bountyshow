![Bitcoin hashrate triples since June 28 in recovery from China
syndrome][1]

The hashrate for the Bitcoin network has made a remarkable recovery
since it crashed following China’s crypto mining clampdown earlier this
year. The Bitcoin hashrate has now topped 150 Exahashes, or one
quintillion hashes, per second according to data from analytics provider
CryptoQuant. On Aug. 24, the metrics provider reported a hashrate of 152
EH/s which has tripled since it bottomed out this year on June 28 at 52
EH/s.

The recovery of the BTC hashrate means that the network is much more
secure and harder to attack. The average Bitcoin hashrate — the amount
of computing power in the network — hit an all-time high of 197.6 EH/s
on May 13 according to Bitinfocharts. Over the six weeks or so that
followed, it slumped by more than 65% as mining rigs across China were
powered down for the “great miner migration”.

The metric is now approaching early June levels and, if the trend
continues, could hit a new all-time high within the next couple of
months. In early May, Cointelegraph reported that there was already
evidence that hashrate was moving away from China. Details on the
migration are difficult to come by: Cambridge University’s well-sourced
“mining map” has not been updated since April when it reported 65% of
the hashrate residing in China.
