LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s price surged past $50,000 on Monday
for the first time since May, but the rebound from a months-long slump
later ran out of steam.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last down 0.2% at $49,201. It had
risen as high as $50,562 as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bet that the prospect of more U.S.
stimulus spending would lead to further gains, and more mainstream
financial services firms made moves in the nascent asset class.

Bitcoin has climbed 82% since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in
January.

The price retreat was predominately driven by profit taking, according
to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, who also
pointed to a report that some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining from China might abruptly
go offline on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the price of rival cryptocurrency ether was last up 1.97% at
$3,305. The virtual coin has risen 91% since slumping to below $1,740
last month.

The cryptocurrency recovery comes as some more established financial
services companies offer their customers access to virtual coins. PayPal
Holdings Inc said on Monday it would allow customers in Britain to buy,
sell and hold [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies starting this week.

Moya said that fears of capital gains taxation has led some traders to
hold cryptocurrency as a long-term investment, removing some volatility
from the market.

> “New [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are the key to this latest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rally and all signs
show they are comfortable with high risk,” he said in an email, adding
that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) “could see a fast appreciation here and might not hesitate
making a run for $60,000 if appetite for risky assets remain intact.”

Others also believe the upswing could have further to go if more retail
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s return to the market.

> “The last time [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was at $50,000, the Google trends (tracking
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) showing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) searches) was much higher than what it is now,”
Marcus Sotiriou, a sales trader at the UK based digital asset broker
GlobalBlock, said in a note.

> “This suggests that retail euphoria hasn’t entered the market yet and
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has a long way to go in this market cycle.”
