Over the past two months the open interest on Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) has held
reasonably steady even as the figure increased by 118% to reach $8.4
billion as (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high. The result of
Bitcoin’s price appreciation and the rising open interest on BTC [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
has resulted in a historic $3.8 billion expiry set for Jan. 29.

![Bitcoin open interest hits $8.8B as 45% of BTC [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) expire in 2
weeks][1]

To understand the potential impact of such a large expiry, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
should compare it to the volumes seen at spot exchanges. Although some
data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)s display over $50 billion to $100 billion in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
Bitcoin volume, a 2019 report authored by Bitwise Asset Management found
that many exchanges employ a variety of questionable techniques to
inflate trading volumes.

This is why when analyzing exchange volume, it’s better to source the
figure from trusted data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)s instead of relying on the data
provided by the biggest exchanges.

As the above data indicates, BTC’s spot volume at exchanges averaged $12
billion over the past 30 days, a 215% increase from the previous month.
This means the upcoming $3.8 billion expiry translates to 35% of spot
BTC [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) average volume.

Exchanges offer monthly expiries, although some also hold weekly [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
for short-term contracts. Dec. 25, 2020 had the largest expiry on record
as $2.4 billion worth of option contracts expired. This figure
represented 31% of all open interest and shows how [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are usually
spread out throughout the year.

Data from Genesis Volatility shows that Deribit’s expiry [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for
Jan. 29 holds 94,060 BTC. That unusual concentration translates to 45%
of its contracts set to expire in twelve days. A similar effect holds at
the remaining exchanges, although Deribit has an 85% market share
overall.

It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry as some of
those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are
less than two weeks left.

The bullish $46,000 call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and above are now deemed worthless and
the same has happened to the bearish put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) below $28,000, as 68%
of them are now effectively worthless. This means that only 39% of the
$3.8 billion set to expire on Jan. 29 are worth exploring.

Analyzing open interest provides data from trades that have alreadyd
passed, whereas the skew indicator monitors [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) in real time. This
gauge is even more relevant as BTC was trading below $25,000 just thirty
days ago. Therefore, the open interest near that level does not indicate
bearishness.

When analyzing [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), the 30% to 20% delta skew is the single most
relevant gauge. This indicator compares call (buy) and put (sell)
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) side-by-side. A 10% delta skew indicates that call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are
trading at a premium to the more bearish/neutral put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). On the
other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside
protection and is a signal that traders are bearish. While a $3.8
billion [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) expiry is spine tingling, nearly 60% of the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are
already deemed worthless. As for the remaining open interest, bulls are
mainly in control because the recent price hike to a new all-time high
obliterated most of the bearish [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). With the expiry moving closer,
a growing number of put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) will lose their value if BTC remains
above the $30,000 to $32,000 range.
