(ASIC) machines were confiscated.

Illegal Operations][1]

The machines had purportedly been consuming 95 megawatts per hour of
electricity at a reduced rate, according to Tavanir’s head Mohammad
Hassan Motavalizadeh.

Earlier this month, Iranian authorities shut down 1,620 illegal
cryptocurrency mining farms said to have collectively used 250 megawatts
of electricity over the past 18 months, per a different [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) source.

The country’s recent blackouts across major cities have been in part
blamed on cryptocurrency mining, drawing the ire of officials who have
sought a temporary stay on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 5.02%) mining until further
notice.

Cryptocurrency researcher Ziya Sadr told the Washington Post on Sunday
miners had “nothing to do with the blackouts” claiming they only made up
a “very small” percentage of overall electricity capacity in the
country.

In July of last year, Iran penned a registration directive forcing
miners to disclose their identities. It also forced them to disclose the
size of their mining farms and their mining equipment type with the
Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade.
