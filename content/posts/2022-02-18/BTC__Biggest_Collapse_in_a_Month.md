Bitcoin collapsed on Thursday, the most in almost a month amid sales of
risky assets. BTC lost 7.7%, ending the day near $40,700. Ethereum fell
7.7%, while other leading altcoins from the top ten also fell, from 5.4%
(Binance Coin) to 8.5% (Terra).

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to CoinGecko,
sank by 7.3%, to $1.94 trillion. Bitcoin sold more actively than
altcoins, which led to a decrease in the Bitcoin dominance index by
0.3%, to 39.8%. The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index plummeted 22
points to 30, returning to a state of fear.

Bitcoin has clearly lost its function as a defensive asset lately,
showing almost no correlation with gold, which was in high demand on
Wednesday and Thursday.

The technical picture looks bearish in the short term. Bitcoin did not
hold above the 50-day average and fell under previous local lows. It is
quite possible that from the end of January to mid-February, we saw a
pullback after the momentum of the decline, and now a new step down is
being formed.

JPMorgan Bank indicated that crypto assets would be negatively affected
by tightening US monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This approach puts crypto on a par
with growth companies, which have also come under increased pressure
amid rising market interest rates in recent weeks.

Charles Munger, an associate of legendary [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Warren Buffett,
likened cryptocurrencies to a “venereal disease” and praised China for
banning them. According to him, cryptocurrencies are used by hackers,
criminals, as well as those who evade taxes.
