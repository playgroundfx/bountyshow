Bitcoin price still has a CME futures gap unfilled at $9,600 but that
doesn’t mean $11K won’t be reclaimed soon. The price of Bitcoin (BTC)
has been stagnating in recent weeks, as it couldn’t break above $11,000
and couldn’t drop below $10,000, the ultimate sign of a continued range-
bound structure. Such a range-bound and sideways structure could
strengthen some relief on the markets, as the altcoins — especially the
DeFi sector — have seen massive selloffs in recent weeks.

However, what’s next for Bitcoin as the futures expiration (Friday) most
likely will cause short-term volatility? The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart is showing a
clear downtrend since $12,400. The fakeout above $12,000 marked the end
of an uptrend with a clear rejection of the $12,000 level as
confirmation. As the chart shows, constant lower highs are fabricated,
initiating that the price is in bearish modus since this peak high.
First of all, the $12,000 level was confirmed for resistance, and after
that, the $11,100 area flipped from support to resistance. Given that
the current trend is down, a further downward drop is looking more
likely after $10,000 to make another lower low. The next support level
can then be the CME gap at $9,600, which is still unfilled.

The CME chart shows the gap that’s still unfilled. As the majority of
the CME gaps get filled, it’s also likely to expect a close of this CME
gap in the future. The primary scenario for the weakness across assets
is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Globally, concerns and fear for
another round of lockdowns due to the coronavirus caused the markets to
pull back.

Commodity, crypto, and equity markets have been showing weakness in
recent weeks, with [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s flowing into “safe havens,” namely the U.S.
dollar. However, as the USD is fighting a potential resistance level, a
correction is now likely. Bitcoin and other assets might see a relief
rally if the USD corrects.

After a big impulse move, consolidation and accumulation take a long
time before a new impulse move can start. As the recent one occurred in
August (from $10,000 to $12,400), it’s likely to expect several months
of sideways consolidation before new fireworks may occur.
