SINGAPORE, May 3 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency ether hit a record high on
Monday to trade within a whisker of $3,000, extending last weekâ€™s rally
in the wake of a report that the European Investment Bank (EIB) could
launch a digital bond sale on the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network.

Ether hit $2,989.95 in early Asia trade. It is up about 300% for the
year so far, outpacing a 95% rise in the more popular [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Ether is
the digital currency or token that facilitates transactions on the
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by
market cap behind [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources, that the EIB
plans to issue a two-year 100-million euro digital bond.

Bitcoin traded slightly softer at $56,396 on Monday.
