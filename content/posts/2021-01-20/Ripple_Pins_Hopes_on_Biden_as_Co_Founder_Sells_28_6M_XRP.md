After ending 2020 facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission under Donald Trump’s administration, Ripple’s leadership is
looking to the new year and a new U.S. President to bring a change in
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s more favorable to the firm. According to a post on the
Ripple [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) featuring comments from key executives, the firm is
predicting the incoming Biden administration will most likely “bring a
renewed focus on [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and enforcement” in the crypto space.

Both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen have been
vocal about their criticism of the SEC’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of “[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) through
enforcement” prior to the lawsuit. Stu Alderoty, general counsel for the
firm, was quoted in the piece as saying he believes the Biden
administration would make crypto [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) a top priority over the next
four years because it “understands its implications for public and
private sector innovation.”

> “Intelligent, well thought-out [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s communicated effectively
and uniformly applied can help level the playing field and unleash
innovation and further mainstream adoption here in the U.S.” The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
comes as Jed McCaleb resumed his extraordinary sell off of portions of
the 9.5 billion XRP he received as a co-founder of Ripple before leaving
the firm in 2014. Crypto analyst Leonidas Hadjiloizou reported that
yesterday McCaleb sold 28.6 million XRP — roughly $8.5 million at the
time of publication — following 25 days of no apparent activity after
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) broke of the Ripple SEC lawsuit.

McCaleb still has billions of XRP tokens available in his wallets. In
December, Whale Alert reported that the Ripple co-founder liquidated 1.2
billion XRP in 2020 for more than $400 million, bringing the total
number of his remaining XRP tokens to roughly 3.25 billion at the time
of publication, or $970 million.

Ripple is currently facing a lawsuit from the SEC filed in December
alleging the firm has been selling XRP tokens in violation of U.S.
securities laws. The case is scheduled for a virtual pretrial conference
on Feb. 22.
