Just recently Russia’s State Duma released a draft of proposed
litigation toward cryptocurrencies and companies that deal with the
technology. The draft called “On Digital Financial Assets,” is an
updated version on how lawmakers might regulate the crypto industry in
the near future. The documents do not delve much into personal holdings,
trading, and cross-border remittances, unless it is applied to startups
and veteran companies that leverage cryptocurrencies. People can own
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) or other digital assets, but the new proposal does prohibit the
widespread circulation and even evangelism when it comes to digital
currencies versus the Russian ruble.

![Despite Russia’s Confusing Crypto Laws, P2P Bitcoin Trade Volumes
Soar][1]

> “Сryptocurrencies go completely into the gray zone in Russia,”
explains Waves Enterprise representative Artem Kalikhov. “People who own
one or two [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s are not at risk. But all [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s
and wallets hosted on Russian sites with a .ru at the end are now at
risk.”

Despite the newly updated proposal, Russian trade volume for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
(BTC) on the peer-to-peer trading platform Local[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s (LBC) has been
surging. For two months straight Russia has outpaced a number of other
countries who have also been seeing significant trade volumes stem from
the Russian people. Coin Dance statistics indicate that Russia has
accounted for 20% of May’s LBC trade volume. Even though regulatory
clarity has kept Russians in the dark, LBC’s data shows that citizens
from the region are demanding more [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) than they have in years.

Data from Bitcoin.com’s local [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cash (BCH) marketplace,
Local.Bitcoin.com, indicates that Russians are trading a lot of BCH as
well. In popular regions like Venezuela and Colombia, there are people
who have traded 50 to over 100 times using Local.Bitcoin.com. In Russia,
however, traders have settled over a thousand buys and sells in the
local region. People accept credit cards, Advcash, Qiwi, and bank
transfers. One trader from Russia shows that he/she has settled over
15,000 trades in the country purchasing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cash.

Russia was recently featured in an Onfo research report, which had shown
the country saw a faster network effect than the likes of the U.S. and
Germany. The trend of adoption continues despite Russian lawmakers
proposing a law that will allegedly criminalize buying [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) with
cash.
