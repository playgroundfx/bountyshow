Last weekend was very bright for the crypto market. Bitcoin touched $45K
and then faced selling pressure. Nevertheless, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s almost [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
growth since the beginning of the month has set crypto market
participants up for the positive. The benchmark cryptocurrency’s growth
in price came with higher trading volumes, though they are far from this
year’s highs.

Bitcoin is trading around $44K. The positive trend of the previous days
suggests that the bulls are in the mood for a return to levels near
$50K, where the last strong sell-off of Bitcoin started in May. From the
position of the tech analysis, Bitcoin is enjoying bullish momentum,
having received support earlier in August on the decline to the 200-day
simple average and breaking above sideways range resistance near $40k.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and the major cryptocurrencies
showed sharp gains, reaching 74, consistent with the Greed Mode. The RSI
index for the BTCUSD on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart exceeded 70, entering the
overbought area. However, consider that Bitcoin often has very long FOMO
periods, so it is better to remain cautious in opening short positions.

The most important event last week was Ethereum’s hardfork called
London. This event had a very noticeable effect on the price of the
leading altcoin. The price of the coin exceeded $3K, at one point
reaching $3,200. In 7 days, it is still up 17% as it was growing “above
the market” because of hardfork. The price momentum was supported by
16,000 ether coins “burned” and commission three times drop on the
Ethereum network. Network upgrade goals are being met, and developers
continue moving to ETH 2.0 in 2022.

Fundamentally negative could be the factor of tighter US authority’s
position. The US is moving towards stricter controls, de-anonymisation
of cryptocurrency users, and increased tax collection from this sector.
On the one hand, one can rejoice at the greater transparency and reduced
risks for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. On the other, in the background of protecting
market participants, many scenarios can be implemented that will
eventually work against holders of digital assets.

At the very least, the US government’s immediate plans include raising
taxes to fund massive support programs for the economy. The economy is
showing long-awaited signs of recovery, and, likely, US authorities will
soon begin to tighten their stance on all fronts at once, which will
also affect cryptocurrencies.
