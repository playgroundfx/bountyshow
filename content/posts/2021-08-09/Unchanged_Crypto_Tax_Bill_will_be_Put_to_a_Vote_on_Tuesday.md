![Unchanged crypto tax bill will be put to a vote on Tuesday][1]

The provisions aim to raise $28 billion for infrastructure funding
through expanded digital asset taxation and will impose broad third-
party reporting requirements on any crypto firm deemed to be a “broker.”
On Monday, Jake Chervinsky, general counsel to Compound Labs, tweeted
that the United States Senate had voted 68 in favor to 29 against ending
the debate surrounding the provisions, halting discussions until
Tuesday’s final vote.

However, Chervinsky emphasized that the Senate could still pass an
amendment to the bill by unanimous consent before the final vote. Senate
talks over the controversial cryptocurrency tax provisions to the U.S.
infrastructure bill have stalled, with an unamended version of the bill
set to be put to a vote on Tuesday. The broad language used to define a
crypto “broker” in the provision has sent shockwaves across the crypto
industry, with analysts inferring that miners, stakers and other network
validators, and software developers could be subjected to third-party
tax reporting requirements despite failing to possess personal
information on their counter-parties.

The crypto sector has thrown support behind an amendment proposed by
senators Pat Toomey, Rob Wyden and Cynthia Lummis that would limit the
definitional scope of crypto “brokers” to exempt miners, validators and
software developers from the provision. However, the majority of
lawmakers are backing a competing amendment from Rob Portman, Mark
Warner and Kyrsten Sinema that would only exempt miners, proof-of-stake
validators and wallet providers from the bill.

According to a Sunday Twitter thread from Lummis, both sides are now at
an impasse over the 30-hour rule — which allows senators to consider a
bill for up to 30 hours before voting on it.
