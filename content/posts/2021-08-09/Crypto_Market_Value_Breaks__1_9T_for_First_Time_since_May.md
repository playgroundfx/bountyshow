![Total crypto market value breaks $1.9T for the first time since
May][1]

The cryptocurrency market has continued a solid bullish trend in early
August, with the total market capitalization nearing $2 trillion.
According to data from crypto data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) CoinGecko, the total
crypto market cap broke the $1.9-trillion mark on Monday, retouching
this level for the first time since May 18. Starting July 19,
cryptocurrency markets recorded a notable rise, with market value
surging nearly $700 billion. The market is still down roughly $700
billion from the all-time high of $2.5 trillion recorded on May 11.

In line with the strong recovery trend, major cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have retested their mid-May levels in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market capitalization. Bitcoin’s market value hit above $860
billion on Monday, surging this high for the first time since May 16,
according to CoinGecko. After breaking into a $1-trillion asset earlier
this year, Bitcoin experienced a major sell-off, with its market cap
dropping to $560 billion as of July 20. As Bitcoin’s price surged back
above $45,000, BTC’s market value has increased by over 53%.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has posted more
gains since the bear market in July, surging nearly 81% from $204
billion on July 20 to $369 billion on Monday. The cryptocurrency
underwent a major network upgrade on Thursday, with ETH’s price rallying
50% following the London hard fork amid [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) expectations for the
upgrade to solve issues such as high transaction fees.
