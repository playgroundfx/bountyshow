Bitcoin’s remarkable ascent past $30,000 has stunned Wall Street — and
one of the biggest U.S. investment banks thinks the digital currency
could have much further to run.

In a note published Monday, JPMorgan made a bold long-term price target
for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), claiming the red-hot cryptocurrency could rally as high as
$146,000 as it competes with gold as an “alternative” currency. But,
there’s a catch.

Bitcoin’s market cap — calculated by multiplying the price by the total
number of coins in circulation — currently stands at over $575 billion.
According to JPMorgan, it would have to climb by 4.6 times to match the
$2.7 trillion of private sector gold investment.

For [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s market value to reach that level, its price volatility
would need to drop substantially to give institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s the
confidence required to make large bets. Bitcoin is known for its wild
volatility, and it fell sharply Monday to briefly dip below $30,000 just
days after reaching that level.

Bitcoin was up 1% in the last 24 hours Tuesday, trading at around
$31,720, according to data from crypto market data provider Coin
Metrics.

> “This long term upside based on an equalization of the market cap of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to that of gold for investment purposes is conditional on the
volatility of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) converging to that of gold over the long term,”
JPMorgan’s strategists wrote.

>

> “The reason is that, for most institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the volatility
of each class matters in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of portfolio risk management and the
higher the volatility of an asset class, the higher the risk capital
consumed by this asset class.”

Crypto bulls have said that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s recent rally is markedly different
to a late 2017 bubble that saw it zoom close to $20,000 a coin, only to
sink as low as $3,122 the next year. That’s because institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are starting to buy in, and this is seen as a crucial
confidence boost for the digital asset.

Skeptics view [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s 2020 rally — which saw it advance more than 300%
— as reminiscent of the frothy 2017 market action. They see it as a
speculative asset with no intrinsic value and a bubble that is likely to
burst at some point.

Still, JPMorgan says there’s “little doubt that the institutional flow
impulse into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is what distinguishes 2020 from 2017.”

> “A convergence in volatilities between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and gold is unlikely to
happen quickly and is in our mind a multi-year process. This implies
that the above $146k theoretical [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price target should be
considered as a long-term target, and thus an unsustainable price target
for this year.”

Many institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are using investment vehicles like
Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust as a means of buying into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). According
to JPMorgan, more than $3 billion has flowed into the Grayscale Bitcoin
Trust since mid-October while gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have bled $7 billion.

Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may find JPMorgan’s lofty price target for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) quite
jarring. The bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon once called the cryptocurrency a
“[fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)” and said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mania is reminiscent of the tulip bulb craze in
the 17th century.

Dimon is, however, more supportive of the underlying [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technology that served as the foundation for digital currencies like
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). JPMorgan has invested heavily in the space, creating its own
digital currency called JPM Coin and establishing a new unit devoted to
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).
