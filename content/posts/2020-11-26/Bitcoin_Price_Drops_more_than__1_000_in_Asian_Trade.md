Bitcoin hiccoughed in Asian trading on Thursday to at one point stand
more than 6% down on the day after failing to make record highs.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest and best-known crypto-currency, was last
trading around $17,700, having lost more than $1,000 since its previous
close.

> “With very high volumes on spot but also on leveraged markets, it’s
not surprising that after failing to hit the all-time highs, there would
be this sort of rapid correction,” said Justin d’Anethan sales manager
at digital asset company Diginex.

> “While a quick visit in the upper or mid-16,000s is possible, we’re
still trending up and with plenty of upside potential,” he added

This year, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has risen 358.6% from the year’s low of $3,850 on
March 13, but has not yet breached the $19,666 hit in December 2017.

Analysts say that this latest rally differs from 2017’s as there are
proportionally fewer retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and more institutions such as
hedge funds and family offices trading cryptocurrencies.
