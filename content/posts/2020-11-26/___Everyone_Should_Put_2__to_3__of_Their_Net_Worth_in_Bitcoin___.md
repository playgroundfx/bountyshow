Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is back. The most popular cryptocurrency has breached
$19,000 and is approaching the record high it touched in 2017, before a
spectacular crash. Longtime bull Mike Novogratz said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a solid
buy for everyday [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. “Bitcoin is for everyone,” he said in an
interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “Everyone should put 2% to 3% of
their net worth in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and look at it in five years, and it’s going
to be a whole lot more.”

![‘Everyone should put 2% to 3% of their net worth in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’: Mike
Novogratz][1]

Novogratz is a big player in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and a big character in most of the
circles in which he’s moved — Princeton, wrestling, Goldman Sachs and
Fortress Investments. Previously a more conventional — although maverick
— hedge fund manager, he started Galaxy Digital in 2018 to try to raise
crypto’s institutional bona fides, and of course to make money. By the
end of the third quarter, Galaxy Digital had $407.4 million in assets
under management, and the firm’s digital trading platform processed $1.4
billion in trading volume. (For context, the total market cap of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
is more than $350 billion).

Bitcoin’s current rally is a lot quieter than its last one. Google
searches for “[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)” peaked in late 2017; they’re now running at about
one-fifth of that level. But Novogratz said the evidence supporting
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices is better than it’s ever been. He said that it’s likely
crypto will be volatile, but that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices shouldn’t fall below
$12,000 in this current cycle.

While the last [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rally was driven mostly by individual [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
the big boys are playing this time, said Novogratz. “This rally is being
driven by institutions slowly getting into the space, high net-worth
individuals, hedge funds, real institutions. Bitcoin’s become a macro-
asset.” Participation by those larger players — plus increased
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) — should smooth out, although not eliminate, some of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s volatility.

Novogratz’s enthusiasm for crypto extends to so-called altcoins, smaller
currencies with much less liquidity and volume than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) or [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/),
another more established cryptocurrency.

But he cautions they’re not for everyday [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. “You know, you can
lose 60% of your money in a day. And so fair warning, if you’re going to
play in those things, do it with small size and know what you’re doing,”
he said.

Novogratz’s interest also extends well beyond crypto. He’s an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
in several ventures focused on therapeutic psychedelics. He also raised
money to defeat President Donald Trump’s re-election.
