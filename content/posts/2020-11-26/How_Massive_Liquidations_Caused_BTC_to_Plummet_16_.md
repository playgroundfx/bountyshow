Bitcoin (BTC) price fell by a whopping 16% to $16,334 on Nov. 26 since
achieving its peak at $19,484 the previous day. Data suggests that
cascading liquidations were the driving force of the massive correction.
Prior to the pullback, the open interest of the Bitcoin futures market
hit a new record high. The derivatives market was also overheated with
buyers, causing the market to sway to one side. The combination of two
factors triggered a rapid BTC price drop alongside a spike in futures
trading volume.

![How Massive Liquidations Caused BTC to Plummet 16%][1]

Over a billion dollars worth of futures contracts were liquidated,
similar to the March 12 crash. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for
example, saw $1.8 billion in volume â€” its highest ever, according to
Skew.

As the price of Bitcoin started to drop, inflows into exchanges spiked.
This indicates that whales, or high-net-worth [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, were selling
heavily on major exchanges, including Coinbase.

Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that the All Exchanges
Inflow Mean indicator was showing the selling pressuring coming from
whales.

Initially, the sell-off from whales caused the price of Bitcoin to drop
to around $18,000. But, because there was likely a large number of
overleveraged long contracts, it led to a massive long squeeze.

Within several hours, Bitcoin declined to as low as $16,334, posting a
March-like crash. Data suggests that nearly $1.9 billion worth of
futures contracts were liquidated on the day.

According to Glassnode, an on-chain market data analysis firm, Binance
Futures saw the largest spikes in liquidations of $425 million in just
two hours at 3 am and 8 am UTC.

Massive price swings following a minor initial pullback were largely
expected because of the high funding rates. The market has been
overwhelmingly long on buying BTC since early November, which increased
the risk of a sharp BTC correction.

What happens now?  
Order books of major exchanges were obliterated and as a result, the
cryptocurrency market saw a massive short-term correction.

There are three potential scenarios for Bitcoin in the near term. First,
it could recover relatively quickly to $18,000. Second, it could
continue declining to the next major support area at $13,700. Third, it
could range, allowing the derivatives market to stabilize.
