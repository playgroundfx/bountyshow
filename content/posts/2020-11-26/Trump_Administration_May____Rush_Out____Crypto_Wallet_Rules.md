Brian Armstrong is worried the Trump Administration is about to send the
cryptocurrency industry a parting gift. The Coinbase CEO took to Twitter
Wednesday night to blast the U.S. Treasury Department’s rumored plans to
attempt to track owners of self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets with an
onerous set of data-collection requirements.

Wallet Rules][1]

If the whispers are to be believed, outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin is preparing to tamp down on one of the fundamental tenets of
the cryptocurrency ethos: the ability of the individual to hold their
crypto (unmolested) themselves.

> “This proposed [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) would, we think, require financial
institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-
hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before
a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet,” Armstrong
tweeted.

If true, the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) would represent a broadside against the U.S.
cryptocurrency industry like few ever levied by the federal government.
It would force corporations to know every counterparty to their users’
crypto transactions, keeping logs, tracking movements, and verifying
identities even before a transfer could take place.

It would also bring to pass the worst-case scenario envisioned by
industry players when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an
intergovernmental body, told its member countries to apply the so-called
travel rule to crypto businesses last year. This long-standing rule
requires financial institutions to collect information about the sender
and receiver of a money transfer. But it was ambiguous what that would
mean when someone sends [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -10.66%) from, say, their Coinbase
account to an address controlled by a private key on a sheet of paper
kept in a sock drawer.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.
