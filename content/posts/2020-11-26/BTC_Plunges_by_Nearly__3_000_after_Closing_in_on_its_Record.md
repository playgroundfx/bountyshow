Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2020, skyrocketing over 150% in a jump
crypto enthusiasts have credited to unprecedented monetary and fiscal
stimulus in response to the Covid-19 crisis, as well as interest from
big-name [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.
The latest tumble comes as many predicted the cryptocurrency would soon
hit an all-time high of $20,000.

Antoni Trenchev, a managing partner and co-founder of Nexo, which bills
itself as the world’s biggest crypto lender, said he expects [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to
rally well into the $20,000s and beyond. “Long term I don’t see anything
derailing Bitcoin’s irrevocable rise higher,” said Trenchev. “That
doesn’t mean we won’t have pullbacks along the way. Look what happened
in March; Bitcoin plunged 40% in one day during the coronavirus market
panic. 20-30% falls can and should be expected.” He added: “Any healthy
market needs to have pullbacks and periods of consolidation. Already in
2020 we’ve seen a gain of 160%.”
