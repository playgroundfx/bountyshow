million into Ether and Bitcoin, taking its net spend on crypto up to
roughly $90 million this month. The Hong Kong and China listed company

In the latest announcement, the company noted that while cryptocurrency
is still in its formative stages, it believes that [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology
has the potential to be a disruptive force in existing financial and
technology industries: “The Board believes that the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) industry
is still in its early stage, analogous to the mobile internet industry
in circa 2005. Against this backdrop, the Board believes
cryptocurrencies have ample room for appreciation in value.”

The company also cited the growing trend of large institutions such as
Tesla and Microstrategy accumulating Bitcoin, and the increasing
acceptance for cryptocurrency as a form of payment for goods and
services in mainstream society, as reasons for the additional purchase.
