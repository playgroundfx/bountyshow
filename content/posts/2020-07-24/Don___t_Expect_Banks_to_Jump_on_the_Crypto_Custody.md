Banks can now offer cryptocurrency and digital asset custody to their
clients, but what does this really mean? As you may know, the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced Wednesday that
nationally chartered banks in the U.S. can now jump into the crypto
custody arena. There are plenty of opinions about what impact this will
have on the industry, and many of them are at odds.

![Don’t Expect Banks to Jump on the Crypto Custody][1]

Some feel this is the beginning of a new era for the industry where
banks will be able to offer complimentary digital asset services
attractive to sophisticated [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s; or, even more optimistically,
that a Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) is more likely to be approved. Others have lamented
that banks will audit and tax every penny, or, even worse, that they
will readily agree to help the federal government seize coins in the
future.

Here’s the thing. Traditional financial institutions, banks included,
move slowly. Most make turtles look like they’re in a hurry. So, don’t
expect any to announce their brand new custody platform immediately, if
at all.  
According to a recent Fidelity survey, only about a third of all these
firms even own crypto.

Think about that for a second. Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in this space are here
because they are weary of being exposed to the systemic risk that having
digital assets custodied in a traditional financial institution could
create. They are hedging against the very network that’s trying to
encroach on Bitcoin.

THE BULK OF BANKS AND OTHER SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS IN THE OLD SCHOOL
MARKETS DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OUR INDUSTRY.

Given this unusual (and vocal) segment of our industry, banks may not
have quite the opportunity they think they do, and a significant share
of crypto asset traders and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may avoid them altogether and
stick with crypto native firms that are somewhat insulated from the
potential problems of a Northern Trust or a State Street, both of which
are large traditional custodians that took TARP bailout funds during the
Great Recession.

Once all the headlines surrounding this announcement fade away, what
will we be left with? Probably not many new custodial entrants from this
regulatory approval in the short term, but the bright hope that the
onlookers will see the acknowledgement from our government that crypto
is real, at least real enough for the house that Morgan built to be
allowed to do business with it.
