March 5 (Reuters) - Cipher Mining Inc said on Friday it will go public
through a merger with blank-check firm Good Works Acquisition Corp in a
deal that values the combined company at $2 billion.

The deal will provide the merged entity with gross cash proceeds of $595
million, which includes $425 million from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s including Fidelity
Management & Research Company and Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global.

The combined company, to be named Cipher Mining Inc, is expected to be
listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “CIFR”.

Cipher Mining is a newly-formed cryptocurrency mining company and is a
unit of Bitfury Top HoldCo, a provider of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining tools and
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) software.

Good Work, a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, raised $150
million through an initial public offering last year.

SPACs are shell companies which raise funds to acquire a private company
with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep
a traditional IPO to enter public markets.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities LLC are serving as
financial [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s to Good Works and Cipher Mining, respectively, on the
deal.
