Elon Musk once again sent ripples through the price of Bitcoin after
declaring that he’s a supporter of the largest cryptocurrency. Speaking
on social audio app Clubhouse, the billionaire said at this point he
thinks “Bitcoin is a good thing,” adding he’s “late to the party” and
should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago.

The digital coin spiked to almost $34,500 Monday amid the comments,
before easing back. It surged as much as 16% on Jan. 29 to over $38,000
after Musk changed his Twitter profile to “#[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).” That rally mostly
ebbed by Monday. Cryptocurrencies have been buffeted recently by
volatile retail-[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) demand shaped online by Twitter feeds and
Reddit forums. Dogecoin — a Shiba Inu-themed digital coin that started
as a joke — rallied into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value
last week before plunging over the weekend.

On Clubhouse, Musk said he doesn’t have a strong view on other
cryptocurrencies and that his comments on Dogecoin are meant as jokes,
adding “the most ironic outcome would be Dogecoin becomes the currency
of Earth in the future.” Bitcoin has shed about $8,000 since reaching an
all-time high of almost $42,000 in early January but remains up more
than 260% in the past year.
