Digital asset manager Grayscale is showing little signs of slowing down
its Bitcoin accumulation, adding around 40,000 BTC to its stash since
January 13. That’s around $1.36 billion worth of Bitcoin in just 16
days. The dramatic accumulation was noted by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the
CTO of crypto analytics firm Glassnode, who noted that only 26,000 BTC
have been mined into existence since the start of the year. That means
Grayscale has purchased Bitcoin at a rate that is 54% faster than new
BTC supply has been created during 2021 so far. However the vast
majority was purchased in the last 16 days, meaning that for the past
two weeks Grayscale has been buying around 170% more Bitcoin than was
mined over the same period.

If it keeps buying at such high levels, Grayscale will have amassed
912,500 BTC, or roughly 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, by the end
of 2021. Grayscale purchased more than $5 billion worth of Bitcoin in
2020, with the firm accumulating $251 million weekly on average during
the fourth quarter — driving the value of its total assets under
management to more than $20 billion.
