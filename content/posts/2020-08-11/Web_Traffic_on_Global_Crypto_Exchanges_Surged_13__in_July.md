Global crypto exchanges have reportedly seen a significant increase in
web traffic in July as [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s gained momentum. According
to data from crypto analytics startup ICO Analytics, web traffic on
global crypto exchanges increased by 13% on average in July 2020. Illia
Kmez, head of content at ICO Analytics, told Cointelegraph that
centralized crypto exchanges added 26% in web traffic since December
2020. In order to provide calculations, the startup analyzed web traffic
of around 100 exchanges including international trading platforms and
exchanges that only operate in one country, Kmez said.

While the average stands at 13%, some crypto exchanges have recorded a
more notable monthly increase, with traffic surging over 60% ,as was the
case with YoBit.net and KuCoin. Binance, the world’s largest crypto
exchange, reportedly saw 24.9 million visits in July, with traffic
surging nearly 10%. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange and wallet
service in the United States, recorded 22.5 million visits during that
month, with traffic seeing an 18% increase.

Other popular exchanges like BitMEX and OKEx saw their traffic drop in
July. According to the data, BitMEX’s traffic dropped 1.6%, while OKEx
saw a 6% decline. ICO Analytics also noted that, despite significant
growth of DeFi markets-related traffic, none of DeFi platforms have
reached the level of top 20 centralized exchanges. Earlier in July,
crypto market analytics firm Messari said that DeFi makes up only 1.5%
of the entire crypto market. As of press time, total value locked in
DeFi markets accounts for $4.7 billion, according to DefiPulse.com.
