HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ether fell about 1% on Wednesday ahead of a
technical adjustment to its underlying [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that would
alter the way transactions are processed.

The revamp is currently anticipated to go live on Thursday in most time
zones, according to market players, a little later than previously
expected.

Technically, the upgrade will occur when the 12,965,000th block on the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) has been verified.

The [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) network underpins a range of projects in the crypto world
including non fungible tokens (NFTs) - a crypto asset, representing an
intangible digital item such as an image, video, or in-game item - as
well many decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.

Ether has rallied ahead of the upgrade, rising 40% in the past 15 days
from a recent low. The token has more than tripled in value this year,
outpacing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, though both are
sharply down from highs hit in May.

The upgrade, known as the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, will
alter the way transactions are processed and provide clearer pricing for
them.

It will also reduce the supply of the ether token and is likely to
sharply boost its price.

Pantera Capital Chief Executive Dan Morehead told the Reuters Global
Markets Forum this week that the changes will help ether trade more like
a fixed asset and make it more attractive as a store of wealth.

Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and OKEX said earlier this week that
they were expecting the upgrade to occur at about 11:55 GMT on Aug. 5.
