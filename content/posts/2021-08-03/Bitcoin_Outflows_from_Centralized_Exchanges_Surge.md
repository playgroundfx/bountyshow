![Bitcoin outflows from centralized exchanges surge to 100K BTC
monthly][1]

Bitcoin outflows from centralized exchanges have surged to their highest
level year-to-date, with roughly 40,000 BTC being withdrawn over the
past seven days. According to the Glassnode’s August 2 The Week On-Chain
report, Bitcoin outflows have accelerated to a rate exceeding 100,000
BTC per month for just the third time since September 2019. The on-chain
analytics provider estimates that just 13.2% of circulating BTC are
currently held on exchanges — a new low for 2021.

Outflows surged to nearly 150,000 BTC monthly at the end of April 2020
following the violent “Black Thursday” crash that saw crypto prices
tumble by more than 50% in less than two days after then-U.S. President
Trump announced a travel ban between Europe and the U.S. in March as the
coronavirus pandemic intensified. Despite the aggressive crash, Bitcoin
had rebounded by 150% by the end of May 2020, driving heavy
accumulation.

Outflows again came close to 150,000 BTC monthly in November 2020 as
Bitcoin surged to test its then-record price high of $20,000, with BTC
rallying into new all-time highs the following month.
