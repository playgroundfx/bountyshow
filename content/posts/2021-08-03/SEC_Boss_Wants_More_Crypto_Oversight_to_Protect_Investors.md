![New SEC Boss Wants More Crypto Oversight to Protect Investors][1]

It’s become a parlor game in Washington, on Wall Street, and in Silicon
Valley to figure out where U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair
Gary Gensler stands on cryptocurrencies. Industry lobbyists tune in when
he testifies before Congress. Lawyers parse his speeches. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. wealth advisers recently boasted in a research report about
looking for clues in 29 hours of the Blockchain and Money course he
developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That’s an
arduous but perhaps not novel undertaking, since videos of the classes
have garnered millions of views online, something that amazes even
Gensler.

In his first extensive interview about the digital money craze, Gensler
signaled that his deep interest in the subject doesn’t mean he’s
simpatico with the hands-off oversight approach that many enthusiasts
would like to see. Policymakers have struggled with [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) respond to
the mostly unregulated $1.6 trillion market, which has seen explosive
growth and wild price swings. Gensler is contemplating a robust
oversight regime, centered on establishing safeguards for the millions
of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who’ve been stocking their portfolios with tokens. “While
I’m neutral on the technology, even intrigued—I spent three years
teaching it, leaning into it—I’m not neutral about [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) protection,”
says Gensler, who on Tuesday will give a speech about crypto at the
Aspen Security Forum. “If somebody wants to speculate, that’s their
choice, but we have a role as a nation to protect those [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
against [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/).”

Gensler has asked Congress to pass a law that could give the agency the
legal authority to monitor crypto exchanges, but he says the SEC’s
powers are already broad. There’s been much discussion over the years
about which kinds of digital assets fall under the SEC’s purview. Some
such as Bitcoin that act like currencies are considered commodities, not
securities. But there are thousands of other coins, and Gensler believes
most are unregistered securities that must comply with SEC rules.
