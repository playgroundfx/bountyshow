Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market capitalisation grew another 3%
and has surpassed $2.7 trillion, hurtling towards new all-time highs. At
the same time, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has increased by 2%, clearly
indicating that cryptocurrencies are on a broader growth trajectory.

Bitcoin briefly climbed above $64K overnight but pulled back to levels
just below $63K on Wednesday morning. The RSI on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts is at
60, stepping down after the October rally and reflecting that the market
has cooled enough to clear the way for growth. The crypto Fear & Greed
Index jumped to 76, one-week highs, indicating a shift in crypto-
enthusiasts focus, but not wariness in general.

Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs earlier last month encourages the
search for potential new crypto stars with more room for growth.

The search for these ideas we divide into two streams. The first is an
increase in purchases of top altcoins. These are the one or two dozen
coins with relatively high capitalisation and a long [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), the blue
chips of the crypto market.

First and foremost is Ether, which attracts with its long [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and
uses in multiple projects. Although transactions are pretty expensive,
the developers are on their way to solving this problem, even if this
way is broken up into many stages stretching over the years. In recent
months, the project’s main killer feature has been burning coins for
transactions on the network, which enthusiasts call deflation. (Though
economists can hardly attribute a steady price decline to the fact that
the rate at which crypto coins are burning is outstripping the rate of
creation.)

Another area of search for crypto-enthusiasts and speculators in the
industry is new projects, promising infrastructure or ideas, or good PR.
The best PR man of our time, Elon Musk, is a nice bonus. In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of PR,
what matters is not the coin itself but the extent to which its
followers manage to maintain the hype and thereby promote its ever-
widening acceptance.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are perfect examples from this point of view, as
both managed to break into the top ten most capitalised coins (excluding
stablecoin USDT). The total value of all coins of each of these projects
exceeds $35 billion.

Sandbox is also worth a look among the increasingly popular coins.
Despite a relatively modest 8% growth per day, it has gained more than
240% in seven days. It is more than a year old, but it falls out of
speculators’ sight during periods of market lull, actively accelerating
only during periods of market love for altcoins, like now.

The coin stands out for its trading turnover, which has exceeded $5.27bn
in the last 24 hours, putting it in fifth place behind Bitcoin (36.6bn),
Ethereum (21.1bn) and XRP (5.29bn). Again, we put stable Tether
(86.3bn), and Binance (7.34bn) in a different category as they are
intermediaries for crypto players and interest in them does not affect
the price.
