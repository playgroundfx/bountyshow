NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency investment products and
funds showed net outflows for a second straight week, a report from
digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday, on persistent
concerns about [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and the possible fallout from the Russia-
Ukraine conflict.

The sector posted net outflows of $47 million in the week ended March
18, after experiencing outflows of $110 million the previous week.
Previous to the last two weeks, digital asset investment products saw
seven straight weeks of inflows.

The outflows came amid ongoing efforts to regulate crypto. President Joe
Biden signed an executive order a few weeks ago requiring the government
to assess the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital
dollar, as well as other crypto issues.

Bitcoin saw the largest outflow of $33 million in the latest week, the
report showed, following $70 million outflows previously. Year-to-date
flows remained positive, however, at $63 million.

On Monday, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was down 0.5% at $41,047 . Since its intra-day low on
Feb. 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has gained about 18%.

> "Even though [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has retraced a bit after tagging $42,000 over the
weekend, it still managed to close the week well above $40,000," said
Mikkel Morch, executive director at digital asset hedge fund ARK36.

>

> "Such a retrace seems healthy after a notable move up over the past
week and shouldn't be viewed as a negative reaction to any particular
piece of geopolitical or macro [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). As long as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) stays above
$40,000, there is a good chance of continuation."

Ethereum-based products had outflows of $17 million last week, lower
than the previous week, which saw outflows of $50 million. Ethereum
continues to suffer from negative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment, analysts said,
with year-to-date outflows of $151 million, or 1.2% of total assets
under management.

In contrast, other altcoins saw inflows last week, such as Ripple,
Polkadot, and Solana.

Blockchain-linked equity investment products also posted net inflows of
$17 million last week, up from $4 million the previous week.

Assets under management at Grayscale and CoinShares, the world's two
largest digital asset managers, fell from their highs to $37.25 billion
and roughly $3.7 billion, respectively.
