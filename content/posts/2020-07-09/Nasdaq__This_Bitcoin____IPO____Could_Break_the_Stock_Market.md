Coinbase, the $8 billion [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange, is planning an IPO to become
a publicly-listed company. As rampant speculation sweeps the investing
world, Is there a more devastating FOMO combination than the world of
cryptocurrency diving headlong into a frothy tech bubble?

![Nasdaq: This Bitcoin ‘IPO’ Could Break the Stock Market][1]

Bitcoin’s massive rally in 2017 is probably one of the most famous
speculative bubbles in recent memory. After a stock market crash earlier
this year, the latest FOMO craze has been buying beaten-up equities,
with a particular penchant for bankruptcy. As those companies have
struggled recently, the tech sector has forged ahead.

Companies like Nikola (the EV company that has yet to sell a car) have
seen enormous gains, while established giants like Amazon and Apple are
trading at record highs despite record unemployment claims in the United
States. Enter Coinbase. As the largest and most recognizable
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/), it has found the right time to IPO.

When trading legends like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones have purchased
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as an inflation hedge, how hard is it to imagine that more
pension funds want a coin or two? Especially with almost every major
central bank printing money like there’s no tomorrow.

Given [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s limited liquidity, the prospect of higher transaction
volume would be great [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for Coinbase. Bitcoin is an easy proposition
to sell, and so is Coinbase. That’s why the FOMO could get crazy.

Existing demand is likely why Coinbase is not going through a
traditional IPO. Instead, the exchange is diving straight into the
market via a direct listing.

Behind the scenes, is there another explanation for the rush to IPO? It
could be that indicators are starting to suggest that the economic sugar
rush has peaked and its cash-out time for insiders.

In the meantime, let’s see how crazy things can get for Coinbase’s
stock. Armchair [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, get your popcorn ready.
