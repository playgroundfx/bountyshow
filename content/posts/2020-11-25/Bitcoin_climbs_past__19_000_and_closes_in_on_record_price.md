Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2020, skyrocketing over 150% in a jump
crypto enthusiasts have accredited to unprecedented monetary and fiscal
stimulus in response to the Covid-19 crisis, as well as interest from
big-name [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.

It is now creeping up toward the all-time high of $19,783 which it
posted in a December 2017 rally that saw the values of several
cryptocurrencies surge. After hitting that milestone, the bubble burst
and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) plummeted to as low as $3,122 the following year. But many
crypto fans claim things are different this time. They’ve cheered big
moves in the industry from the likes of Fidelity Investments, Square and
PayPal. PayPal recently started letting its users buy, hold and sell
virtual currencies. The payments giant is set to enable shopping with
crypto early next year.

Bitcoin climbed past $15,000 on Nov. 5 and $18,000 on Nov. 19. Bitcoin’s
market value — which is calculated by multiplying the total number of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s in circulation by the price — now stands at $355.9 billion,
higher than the $331.8 billion it hit in December 2017, according to
CoinDesk.
