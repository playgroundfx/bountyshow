Gold Bullion International co-founder Dan Tapiero believes that it’s
only a matter of time before Bitcoin’s price surges into the six-figure
threshold. Speaking to Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast, Tapiero
asserted that in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of price appreciation Bitcoin is the king, even
though he believes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should own both gold and Bitcoin:

“In the next five years, I can see gold at $4,000, so that’s double. But
if gold is at $4,000, Bitcoin is probably somewhere between $300,000 and
$500,000, so that’s a 20, 30x.” He went on to add, “I don’t really think
that anyone in the gold world […] they are not going to debate that.”

Tapiero believes that institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and finance whales are
likely to invest between five to 15 percent of their portfolios in
Bitcoin and noted that sector was currently worth $100 trillion: “That’s
a huge chunk. I mean, 15% of $100 trillion is $15 trillion.”

Bitcoin is a hedge for the fiat system, he explained, and once its
market cap is in the trillions of dollars, it will become easier to
handle for larger [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, similar to gold.

But gold is a store of value, and that is only one aspect of what
Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is an entire network, and that’s why he believes it
will be much bigger than gold.
