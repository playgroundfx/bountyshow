How high can [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price go? Analysts say the higher the price, the
more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will plow in. Meanwhile, increasing ether [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) volume
on Deribit is likely making derivatives more expensive.

At over $1.6 billion as of press time, momentum in the form of USD/BTC
volumes on five combined major exchanges is set for another banner day.
Tuesday is shaping up to be the second highest in the past month as
billion-dollar volume days for the five exchanges are becoming more
common.

some profit-induced selling but also more bullish buying, according to
Rich Rosenblum, head of trading at crypto firm GSR.

was up Tuesday, trading around $604 and climbing 1.6% in 24 hours as of
