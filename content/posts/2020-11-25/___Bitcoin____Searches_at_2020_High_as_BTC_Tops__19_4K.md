Determining the actual all-time high for BTC is somewhat debatable as
various exchanges have different figures listed. For example, Coinbase
has registered $19,892 as Bitcoin’s peak, whereas BitMEX and Binance
have $19,891 and $19,799 respectively. Thus, for most traders, $20,000
is likely to be the primary focal point that will solidify BTC reaching
a new all-time high.

Pushing through the $19,000 level occurred quicker than many expected,
especially after Bitcoin price plummeted to $18,000 in the evening hours
on Nov. 23. This drop was nearly in tandem with XRP’s 30% drop at
Coinbase after the altcoin pumped to $0.92.

Data from TheTie, a social analytics data platform, shows that as
Bitcoin price lost momentum on Nov. 22 and Nov. 23, trading sentiment
took a noticeable hit when traders anticipated a possible retest of
lower supports in the sub-$18,000 zone.

According to Joshua Frank, the founder at TheTIE:

> “The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) sentiment score looks at how positive or negative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
have been over the last 24 hours versus a rolling 20-day window. This
metric ([daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) sentiment) has been positive (above 50) since Nov. 16 when
Bitcoin was near $16K. For the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) sentiment score to remain positive,
that means that conversations must continually get more and more
positive. So if [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are positive over the last 20 days, they must
be even more positive over the last 24 hours for the score to stay above
50.”

This suggests that regardless of strong pullbacks to say $18,000 or
below, the majority of people investing in or tracking Bitcoin price
still feel overwhelmingly bullish about the digital asset’s prospects
when compared to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price and sentiment data.

Google Trends data also shows that searches for the term ‘Bitcoin’ also
reached a 2020 high today as the price rallied above $19,000 but the
figure is nowhere near the high seen in December 2017.

As shown on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin’s flushout to $18,000 created a
double bottom right at the key support, and bulls stepped in to buy the
dip with 3 successive high volume spikes.

At the time of writing the price has already pulled back to restest the
lower support at $18,900 and if this level fails to hold then the next
support is at $18,650 which is slightly above the 20-MA and a high
volume node on the VPVR.

Similar to the move up to $18,000, a period of consolidation and support
building is normal and healthy for sustaining momentum in an uptrend.
