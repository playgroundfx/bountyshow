![Ethereum documentary featuring Vitalik Buterin raises $1.9M in 3
days][1]

The cryptocurrency community is highly anticipating the release of a new
documentary about the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), with the film’s funding
campaign exceeding expectations. A crowdfunding round for the Ethereum-
themed documentary, dubbed Ethereum: The Infinite Garden, has surpassed
its goal of 750 Ether (ETH), raising a total of 1,035.96 ETH worth $1.9
million as of Friday, the creators announced.

The funding campaign started on Wednesday to support the production of a
feature-length, character-driven documentary film exploring the
“innovative real-world applications of the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), the die-
hard community of enthusiasts and developers, and its creator, Vitalik
Buterin.” Ending Friday, the fundraising campaign amassed a total of 662
backers who contributed through Mirror, a decentralized crypto-based
network. “We are blown away by the support of the community. In 3 days
we surpassed our goal,” the project creators said.

Some 95% of raised funds will be directed toward the film’s production
budget, while 3% will be distributed on Gitcoin grants to support open-
source Ethereum projects, and the remaining 2% will be sent as a
donation to Carbonfund.org, an initiative to reduce global carbon
emissions.
