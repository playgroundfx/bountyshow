LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell on Tuesday to its lowest in almost a
month, slumping below $30,000 as regulators continued calls for tighter
checks on cryptocurrencies.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 5% to $29,300, its
lowest since June 22. It was last down 3.6% at $29,720.

Smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether and XRP, which tend to move in
tandem with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), also lost around 5%.

Investors said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was likely to test the $28,600 level touched last
month, its lowest since early January.

Bitcoin in recent weeks had been locked in a relatively tight trading
range, after [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sold heavily in May and June following a
crackdown by China on cryptocurrency mining and trading.

Financial watchdogs and central bankers in the West recently have also
called for tighter [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/).

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators on Monday that the
U.S. government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework
for stablecoins, a rapidly growing class of digital currencies.

Bitcoin’s fall on Tuesday took its losses for the month to around 15%.
It has fallen by more than half since hitting a peak of almost $65,000
in April.
