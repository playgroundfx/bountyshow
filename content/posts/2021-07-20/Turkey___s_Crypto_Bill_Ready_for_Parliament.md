![Turkey’s crypto bill ready for parliament, says Deputy Minister of
Finance][1]

The Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance announced that a draft bill
to establish a legal framework for crypto assets in the country is
ready. Deputy Minister Şakir Ercan Gül announced that the crypto bill
would be proposed to The Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the
unicameral Turkish legislature, at the start of the next legislative
year in October 2021. Noting that Turkey is using a free-floating
exchange regime — i.e., the value of the lira is set by the forex market
— Gül said the country needs similar but stricter [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) for crypto
assets than Western Europe or the United States.

He stated that the finished draft aims to protect retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
prevent money laundering and reinforce supervision for crypto exchanges.
The upcoming bill defines different types of crypto assets,
Cointelegraph Turkey reported, and also designates the issuance and
distribution of crypto assets, trading policies and the conditions of
crypto custodial services.

The Turkish Capital Markets Board (SPK) will oversee crypto asset
companies, while the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK)
will audit crypto industry players. The Turkish Ministry of Treasury and
Finance took a defensive stance against crypto assets earlier this year.
The ministry then announced that it was working with the country’s
financial regulators, central bank, BDDK and SPK to prepare a legal
framework for crypto in Turkey.
