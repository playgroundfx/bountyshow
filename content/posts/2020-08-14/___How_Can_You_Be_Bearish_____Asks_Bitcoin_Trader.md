The market capitalization of Tether (USDT) surpassed $12 billion as of
Aug. 14, according to cryptocurrency market analytics firm Coinmetrics.
Meanwhile, some believe the rapidly-rising valuation of the dominant
stablecoin positively benefits Bitcoin (BTC) in the long term. But some
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s also fear that it makes the cryptocurrency market vulnerable.

Tether has been the most widely-utilized stablecoin for several years,
and it has seen exponential growth. In January 2017, the total supply of
Tether was hovering at around $10 million. Within four years, that
number has increased by 1,200-fold.

Tether is used as a substitute for fiat currencies across major
exchanges, including Binance and Bitfinex. As such, cryptocurrency
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s often rely on Tether to store capital on the sidelines.

Coinmetrics researchers explain:

> “Moving into stablecoins allows [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to effectively keep money
parked on the sideline without having to completely cash out into fiat
currency and incurring fees. This rush to safety likely accounted for a
significant portion of the increased stablecoin demand following March
12th.”

Since Tether is often used to hedge against major cryptocurrencies, an
argument could be made that its supply represents capital waiting on the
sidelines. When the supply of Tether expands, it might indicate that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are actively hedging, leaving an abundant supply of capital
ready to enter the crypto market.
