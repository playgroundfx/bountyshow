The original use case for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) might have fallen flat, but the
innovation it unleashed continues to push [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) implementation
forward.

Blockchain and cryptoassets were developed, which at this point is well
known, to disrupt, disintermediate, or otherwise topple the incumbent
financial infrastructure. Democratizing access to financial resources
and information, the argument went, was a slam dunk idea in the
aftermath of the financial crisis. That said, and despite the billions
of dollars invested, thousands of individuals working on the issue, and
the media focus on this potential, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) remains a medium of exchange
only used for a small portion of its total trading volume.

![Bitcoin Failed As Money, And That Is Great News For Crypto][1]

Trading volume across different exchanges for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other
cryptoassets may total in the tens of billions, but utilization of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as a legitimate fiat alternative remains slower than might have
been anticipated. Reasons as to why this has occurred have been
documented extensively, so let’s just summarize them briefly. This is
not to say that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will never catch on, but as of June 2020 that
simply is not the case.

First, price volatility and the near obsession over price levels
discourage both retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and merchants from using [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as an
effective medium of exchange to conduct transactions. Second, and even
though [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is thought of as anonymous, the reality is that
transactions and holdings can (and have) been traced back to real world
owners. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the lack of understanding
and the lingering association of crypto with criminal activity may lead
many non-experts to steer clear.

Several separate cryptoasset sectors have emerged, and continue to grow
rapidly seeking to address some of the very issues that have kept
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) from breaking into the mainstream.

Stablecoins have been widely discussed, but it is important to remember
the fundamental issue these cryptoassets seek to address. Tether, Circle
USD Coin, Paxos, and the Gemini dollar are simply the tip of the iceberg
of a market that has grown to be worth billions of dollars since its
introduction. Price volatility can destroy the use case of any medium of
exchange, and by stabilizing these cryptoassets, stablecoins seek to
lead the way to mass market adoption.

Central bank digital currencies may be the most recent entrant into the
cryptoasset space, but despite that, the ripple effects are already
being felt. Issued and governed by a central bank or other governmental
entity, these cryptoassets (in theory) would operate in compliance with
all applicable [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s. Better yet, the implicit backstop of
governmental support would encourage individuals and merchants alike to
use these cryptoassets as a legitimatized medium of exchange.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) changed the technology, accounting, and financial
markets world; that can be said without a doubt. Despite this impact,
however, crypto in its original form has not been able to gain much of a
toehold among consumers and business owners. Like any free market,
entrepreneurs and innovative organizations continue to launch and
develop new iterations of cryptoassets specifically designed to address
these existing flaws.

Bitcoin’s original use case may have fallen flat, but those stumbles
opened the door to an entire ecosystem of innovative solutions, and that
is a great thing.
