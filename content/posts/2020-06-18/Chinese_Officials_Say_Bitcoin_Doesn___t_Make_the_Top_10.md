The criteria used to evaluate cryptocurrencies include basic technology,
applicability, features, performance, safety, creativity and
decentralization. At the top of the table, EOS leads the [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) with
156.1 points, followed by TRON with 138.43 points and Ether (ETH) with
136.4 points. The leading cryptocurrency scored 20.4 points in
applicability and 24.7 in creativity, while the second place had 28.4
and 15.5 points, respectively.

The fourth and fifth places are IOST and LSK with 130.3 and 119.3
points, respectively, highlighting that XRP is in 14th place with just
105 points. Interestingly, Bitcoin was even lower down the list in a
previous [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/), at 17th place. At that time, it had a rating of only
43 points in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of innovation and 19.9 for applicability.

Tron’s founder and CEO, Justin Sun, warned that Chinese authorities
raised suspicions over the platform’s legal status. This has led to a
tense relationship with Chinese authorities for Sun in recent days. In
2019, an incident involving Tron led to Chinese police surrounding the
project’s office in Beijing. New media at the time claimed that Tron’s
office was raided by police, but Sun indicated that this was “fake
