Bitcoin price fell under $30K as global risk sentiment was hurt by new

Bitcoin’s swing range has declined recently, forming the basis for a
powerful exit with a compressed spring effect.

A sequence of increasingly lower highs is a significant selling factor.
Given the FOMO nature of cryptocurrencies, a prolonged consolidation is
increasingly frustrating for speculators.

The main question now is whether Bitcoin falls to the area near $23.3,
where it paused before last Christmas. We cannot rule out that with
massive liquidation of margin positions the price will even close the
gap at $18k. Overall, such a reversal would be a repeat of the “crypto
winter 2018”, opening the possibility for a price collapse toward a
“bottom” near $10k, nullify the rally since October 2020.

Despite the amplitude of the crypto market’s swings is much smaller now
than in May, the prolonged rise failure indicates that the sharp uptrend
is broken, as it was in 2018. Long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may remain bullish,
but short-term speculators are clearly trying to leave the market.
