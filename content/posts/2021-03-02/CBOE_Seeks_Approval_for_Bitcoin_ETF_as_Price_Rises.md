March 2 (Reuters) - CBOE global markets is seeking approval from the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) Exchange
Traded Fund ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)), according to a filing, the latest attempt to launch
such a product in the United States.

The filing came as Citi analysts said the most popular cryptocurrency
was at a “tipping point” and could become the preferred currency for
international trades, while Reuters reported that Goldman Sachs Group
Inc had restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk.

Bitcoin rose as much as 10% on Monday, amid a broader rise in risk
assets.

While its price has risen significantly over the past year, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
remains highly volatile. The virtual currency smashed through $58,000 on
Feb. 21 then fell back by as much as 25%.

In Asian trading Tuesday morning it struggled to find a clear direction,
hovering around $49,700

The SEC has previously rejected several attempts to list Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.

The CBOE’s filing late Monday U.S. time said investing in Bitcoin via an
exchange-traded product would offer advantages to retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
including access to better custody. Storing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) safely is a common
problem for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) last month became the world’s first
exchange-traded fund physically settled in the cryptocurrency, with
asset managers in the country rushing to launch their own [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.
