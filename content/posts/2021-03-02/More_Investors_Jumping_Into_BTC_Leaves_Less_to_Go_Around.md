Four million. That’s roughly how much [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is circulating freely
right now, [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data show. The number has been getting a little
smaller with each passing month over the last year. It’s the assessment
of Glassnode, an analysis firm that tracks [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data. The pattern
suggests that the ever-decreasing supply of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) available to buy and
sell might lead to a price surge as more institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s embrace
the largest cryptocurrency as an investment.

Bitcoin’s “liquid supply change” – the amount by which the number of
coins in circulation has changed over the prior 30 days – has been
negative for most of the past year, according to Glassnode: That’s a
longer period in negative than seen [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly, potentially providing
more support to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price strength in the long term despite short-
term corrections like last week’s 21% retreat.

As of Monday, there were only about 4 million BTC in constant
circulation and available for buying, trading and selling, according to
Glassnode. The 30-day net change of BTC supply held by liquid and highly
liquid entities has been in the negative territory since last April,
except for a short stint between July and August and again briefly in
December.

> “This has never happened before for such an extended period of time,
and could lead to a massive supply squeeze soon,” Glassnode wrote on
Feb. 26 in its weekly [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter.

The Bitcoin [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s third halving last May cut the pace of mining
rewards to 6.25 BTC for every data block (roughly every 10 minutes) from
12.5 BTC. At the same time, big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs,
Citigroup and BlackRock are now dabbling in cryptocurrencies, while the
payment giants PayPal and Square’s Cash App have allowed their users to
buy and sell the digital assets.
