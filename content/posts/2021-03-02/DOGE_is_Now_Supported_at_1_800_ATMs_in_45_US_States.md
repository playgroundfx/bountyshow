Famous meme crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) can now be accessed through 1,800
ATMs across the United States. Leading Bitcoin ATM provider Coinflip
announced the support for Dogecoin on Mar. 1, with the company’s CEO and
co-founder, Daniel Polotsky, attributing the move to DOGE’s recent
“popularity and recent mass adoption.”

On Feb. 4th, the cryptocurrency’s price rose 25% within minutes after
Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk posted a rocket going to the moon and
adding “Doge” in the comments. Two days later, the world’s second-
richest man continued his Doge shill, posting a survey that asked if
Dogecoin will be the earth’s future currency — to which 71.3% of the 2.4
million respondents said yes. NBA Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban
joined the conversation on Feb. 8, telling Forbes that the attention the
meme coin is receiving is “not a bad look” for the industry.

> “[DOGE] gives you a better chance of winning than a lottery ticket all
while teaching the economics of supply and demand and introducing people
to crypto asserts,” said Cuban. “I truly love it as the lowest cost
economics teaching tool available that entertains at the same time.”

Within the first two weeks of February, the cryptocurrency’s price rose
almost 200% from $0.03 to just shy of $0.09. Since then it has slowly
consolidated near $0.05. Some users have been speculating that
Dogecoin’s price surge wasn’t entirely organic with an 85% price pump
occurring from Reddit group /WallStreetBets after the GameStop saga died
down. A couple of days later on Feb. 1, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons told
Twitter users that he will buy the crypto among others, resulting in an
additional 40% price surge over a 24 hour period.
