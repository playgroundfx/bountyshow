Cryptocurrencies rose on Tuesday on the back of strengthening stock
indices and falling protective assets like gold, the yen, and
treasuries. Bitcoin started its rise before the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about Russia and
Ukraine hit the wires and sparked risk-on sentiments. Technical factors
may have influenced the first cryptocurrencyâ€™s strengthening, with BTC
pushing back from its 50-day moving average, which has been acting as a
support level for the past week.

Russia has proposed allowing cryptocurrency mining in specific regions
and imposing taxes on the conversion of crypto assets into fiat and is
making progress in testing the digital rouble with the first interbank
transfers.

Bitcoin rose on Tuesday to its highest level in the past week ( 4.4%),
ending the day around $44,100, where it is trading on Wednesday morning.
Ethereum jumped 7.3% on Tuesday, settling at $3100, while other leading
altcoins from the top 10 also added: from 1.7% (XRP) to 12% (Avalanche).

Overnight, crypto market capitalisation rose 2% to $1.98 trillion,
according to CoinMarketCap estimates. Since early January, the market
has not been consistently above the 2 trillion mark, and consolidation
above could be an essential signal for bulls to move from observation to
active buying. Since the end of January, there has been a notable
uptrend support line that can be drawn through the local lows, which
sets up optimism in the short term.

The two largest cryptocurrencies, BTC and ETH, are attempting to
consolidate above their 50-day averages, which previously signalled the
end of a bearish phase. This was primarily made possible by optimism on
Wall Street, where [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue to buy out drawdowns. Altcoins
showed outperformance, which led to a 0.3 percentage point decline in
the Bitcoin Dominance Index to 40.4%. The Fear & Greed Index climbed
from 46 to 51, moving into the Neutral from the Fear territory.
