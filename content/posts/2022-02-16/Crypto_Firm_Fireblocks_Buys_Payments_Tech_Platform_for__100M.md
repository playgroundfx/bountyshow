NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Fireblocks, an infrastructure provider for
cryptocurrencies, has acquired First Digital, a stablecoin and digital
asset payments technology platform.

Fireblocks and First Digital said on Wednesday they had reached a cash
and equity deal, without disclosing financial details, but two sources
close to the deal said the purchase price was $100 million.

Fireblocks last month raised $550 million from institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
pushing its valuation to $8 billion.

The First Digital acquisition will expand Fireblocks' existing payment
capabilities allowing payment service providers (PSPs) to accept crypto
payments.

PSPs and large merchants are eager to meet customer demand for crypto
and digital currency payments, but offering these services often entails
challenges such as high wallet integration costs and manual anti-money
laundering screening.

Fireblocks said the addition of First Digital will enhance solutions it
already offers to address those issues.

> "What First Digital brings is an awesome product and extensive
leadership and know-how in the payments domain," Fireblocks Chief
Executive Michael Shaulov told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"Specifically the product they're bringing to the market, I think is
very applicable to the mass market."

First Digital will also launch a business unit within Fireblocks that is
"purely focused on payments and enabling our customers to accept and
remit using several kinds of cryptocurrencies," Shaulov said.

First Digital's payment capabilities include stablecoins,
cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.

First Digital Chief Executive Ran Goldi said the deal was a natural fit,
given the companies had been partners for two years. He added that over
the past six months First Digital "saw lot of interest from companies
that three years ago said we were ahead of our time."

Through First Digital, merchants who work with supported payments
service providers can simply add an option to accept crypto payments,
and the funds are settled in either local currency or crypto.

All First Digital employees will be absorbed by Fireblocks under the
deal.
