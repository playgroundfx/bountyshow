The Bitcoin (BTC) price perked up on Aug. 5, rallying from $11,090 to
$11,784 before briefly retracing to the $11,650 area as the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close
approached. Currently, the price trades near the $11,500 support after
bulls were unable to tackle the $11,800 level. Despite a pullback to
lower support, Wednesday’s 6.29% push through the $11,100 to $11,250
zone was much needed, as the price had lingered below this level for
about three days.

As the 4-hour chart shows, once above $11,450, traders were able to
slice through the $150 gap on the volume profile visible range and
pursue the completion of a W-bottom reversal pattern; however, failure
to pierce $11,800 prevented this. As reported by Cointelegraph earlier
this week, the Aug. 2 flash crash that saw the Bitcoin price drop $1,500
in minutes and liquidate $1 billion did little to shake the bullish
resolve of professional traders.

> According to GSR market analyst Micah Erstling: “The large percentage
of headlines and traditional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s looking for higher yielding
assets has led to a larger shift into crypto. As a result, open interest
in futures listed on major exchanges reached a new lifetime high of $5.6
billion on August 1, surpassing the previous record of $5.36 billion in
February.

>

> Given the increased bullish sentiment, funding rates prior to the
crash were at unsustainable levels as the funding rate for Bitcoin was
hovering around 0.0721%. Furthermore, the imbalance for ETH was even
worse as the funding rate was at 0.21%. However, post sell off, funding
rates have stabilized despite still indicating a bullish tilt.”
