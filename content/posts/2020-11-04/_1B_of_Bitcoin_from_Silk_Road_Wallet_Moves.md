An anonymous crypto user has just moved 69,370 Bitcoin from an address
associated with the Silk Road darknet market, that more recently has
become a popular hacking target.

![$1B of Bitcoin from Silk Road Wallet Moves][1]

According to a Nov. 3 report from crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace,
the recent movement involving two transactions adding up to 69,370
Bitcoin (BTC) — or more than $960 million at the time of publication —
originated from an address connected with the Silk Road marketplace,
which was shut down in 2013. The crypto user first sent 1 BTC — likely
as a test transaction — before moving the bulk of the coins.

The Silk Road funds were contained in a wallet that has been circulating
among hackers for more than two years. In September, a Twitter user
claiming to have the wallet.dat file for the wallet put out a call to
the crypto community for solutions on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) gain access to the more
than 69,000 coins, even suggesting a quantum computer as a potential way
to determine the private keys.

Silk Road was a darknet market which let users buy and sell illicit
goods such as weapons and stolen credit card information, but the
majority of listings were for illegal drugs. Ross Ulbricht, the site’s
founder, is currently serving two life sentences without the possibility
of parole after being found guilty of money laundering, computer
hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. He still provides periodic
analyses on the Bitcoin market from prison.
