Ethereum miners’ hourly revenue has hit a five-year record, with fees
currently bringing in 2,275 ETH ($880K) per hour. The spike was
triggered by yesterday’s announcement that Uniswap would airdrop it’s
governance token UNI to past users of the decentralized exchange.
Following the UNI announcement, more than 70,000 users rushed to claim
free tokens and the gas price surged past 700 Gwei.

Crypto analytics firm Glassnode tweeted that fees had topped $1 million
in an hour: Following UniswapProtocol’s announcement of the $UNI token
today, #Ethereum saw a massive surge in miner fees. Almost $1M USD in
fees were spent in a single hour! These figures dwarf the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) revenue
earned by miners during the late 2017 bull run, which peaked at a little
over 1,000 ETH per hour.

The sky high fees are pushing ordinary users out of the system, and
hurting the bottom line of major exchanges. U.S. crypto exchange
Coinbase Pro announced earlier today that it will no longer cover
network fees much to the disappointment of users.

Numerous other users reported transactions taking hours or failing.
Miners are financially incentivized to process transactions with the
highest fees first, resulting in a massive backlog of the transactions
with lower fees. Further adding to the network bottleneck, each block
has a limit on the amount of gas that can be included in it — reducing
the number of transactions that can be confirmed in the block as fees
increase.

The network congestion is driving users and developers to seek
alternative solutions. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has seen increased
growth this week with Binance founder and CEO CZ boasting the platform
hit 40% of Ethereum’s transaction volume on Tuesday this week.
