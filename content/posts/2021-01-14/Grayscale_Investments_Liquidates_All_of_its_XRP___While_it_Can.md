Institutional crypto-fund manager Grayscale Investments has begun the
dissolution of its XRP Trust in response to the Security and Exchange
Commission’s December 2020 lawsuit alleging the XRP token is a security
under U.S. law. According to an announcement published Wednesday,
Grayscale decided to dissolve the trust in response to the spate of XRP
delistings from major crypto-asset exchanges after the SEC’s complaint
was filed. Grayscale concluded:

“It is likely to be increasingly difficult for U.S. [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, including
the Trust, to convert XRP to U.S. dollars, and therefore continue the
Trust’s operations.” All XRP held by the trust has already been
liquidated, with Grayscale intending to distribute the net cash proceeds
to XRP Trust shareholders after deducting expenses. The trust will be
terminated following the distribution of said cash.

Despite the SEC’s hardline position on XRP, regulators in other
countries are not convinced the token comprises a security. A January
report on cryptocurrency [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) published by the U.K. Treasury
classified XRP as an “unregulated token” alongside leading digital
assets Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with the Treasury describing
unregulated tokens as “neither e-money tokens nor security tokens.” The
report describes XRP primarily as an “exchange token” — a token that is
“primarily used as a means of exchange.” XRP is currently trading for
$0.31 and is down 40% in the past 30 days.
