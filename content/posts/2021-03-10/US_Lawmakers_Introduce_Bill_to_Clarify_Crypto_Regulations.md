Congress may soon try to clarify digital asset [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) in the U.S.
Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) introduced
legislation Tuesday to create a working group composed of industry
experts and representatives from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to
evaluate the current legal and regulatory framework around digital
assets in the U.S.

The three other co-sponsors of the bill are Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Ted
Budd (R-N.C.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio). The ultimate goal of the
legislation, called the “Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021,”
would be to clarify when the SEC has jurisdiction over a particular
token or cryptocurrency (i.e., when it is a security) and when the CFTC
has jurisdiction (i.e., when it’s a commodity).

U.S. [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s can often appear lacking, with no clear rules on when a
certain cryptocurrency is treated as a security or not, with SEC
enforcement actions providing much of the guidance in this area. SEC
Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is outspoken on the issue, tried
tackling it in 2020 by proposing a three-year safe harbor for projects
to get off the ground.

Under the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the bill, Congress would create a working group
within 90 days of the bill’s passage composed of SEC and CFTC
representatives. Non-governmental representatives would come from a
financial technology company, a financial services institution, small
businesses using financial technology, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) protection groups,
organizations that support investments in underserved businesses and at
least one academic researcher.

Within a year, this group would be required to file a report analyzing
current [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, the impact they have on primary and secondary
markets and how the regime impacts the U.S.’ competitive position.

The report would also look at how custody, private key management and
cybersecurity are currently treated under law, and what future best
practices for [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) prevention, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) protection and other issues
could look like. The report would also include recommendations for
improving primary and secondary digital asset markets, including their
“fairness, orderliness, integrity, efficiency, transparency,
availability and efficacy.”
