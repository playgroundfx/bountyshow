![Citigroup Gearing Up to Trade CME Bitcoin Futures][1]

U.S. banking giant Citigroup (NYSE: C) is awaiting regulatory approval
to begin trading [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -3.36%) futures contracts on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME), according to a source within the bank who
asked to remain nameless.

The bank is said to be fielding a surge in client demand for
cryptocurrency exposure as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) again mounts a climb toward $50,000.
Citi, which is still working through the necessary regulatory approvals,
would join fellow megabank Goldman Sachs in offering [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures
trading.

A second person familiar with cryptocurrency derivatives markets said
Citi is actively recruiting people to join a crypto-focused team in
London, adding: “The team is likely to win approval to begin trading CME
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures first and then [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded notes (ETNs).”
“Given the many questions around regulatory frameworks, supervisory
expectations and other factors, we are being very thoughtful about our
approach,” a Citigroup spokesperson told CoinDesk via email. “We are
presently considering products such as futures for some of our
institutional clients, as these operate under strong regulatory
frameworks.”
