When the XRP community is concerned about the price of XRP, there are
often two major issues that are suspected of negatively affecting the
price: The sales of Ripple itself and the sales of former architect and
co-founder of the XRP Ledger, Jed McCaleb. The current CTO of Stellar
Lumens (XLM) was once head of Ripple, but left the company in 2014 due
to a disagreement with Chris Larsen, who was also part of the founding
team and is now managing director at Ripple.

Of the 100 billion XRP created with the genesis block of the XRP Ledger,
20 billion XRP went to the founders, while the other 80 billion XRP went
to Ripple. When Jed McCaleb quit his job, he in turn received 9 billion
of the 20 billion XRP as compensation. In order to prevent a dump of the
market price of XRP, both sides reached an agreement which was renewed
after a break in February 2016.

According to the latter, McCaleb had to donate 2 billion XRP to a
charitable fund (“DAF”) of his choice. The remaining XRP will be held in
a custodial account. Certain rules were established for this account.
The former Ripple co-founder, together with the DAF, is allowed to sell
a maximum of 0.5% of the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) XRP volume on a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis. This
quota rose to 0.75% in the second and third year, and to 1% in the
fourth year. After the fourth year of the agreement, McCaleb and the DAF
may sell 1.5% of the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) XRP volume each day.

McCaleb’s XRP sales reach all-time high  
As XRPArcade has now determined, it is clearly apparent that the first
four years after the agreement passed in February 2020. After February
2020, McCaleb’s sales have risen significantly, as in the past few
months the XRP volume has risen on the one hand, and McCaleb is now
allowed to sell 1.5% of the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume on the other.

As the publication further states, it would take more than six more
years for McCaleb to sell all its XRP if it continued to sell an average
of 1.862 million XRP per day. On the other hand, if he continues to sell
6.180 million XRP per day, his stock could be depleted in less than two
years.

The impact of McCaleb’s sales on the XRP price is controversial in the
crypto community. Just earlier this year, WhaleAlert published a study
according to which McCaleb has sold XRP worth USD 135 million over the
past five years at an average price of USD 0.129. The study identified a
potential risk to the price stability of XRP.

However, there is not much to see of this at the moment. Despite
McCaleb’s sharp increase in sales volume, the XRP price has been making
strong gains during the current bull market.
