LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - This week’s [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) plunge
eroded the dollar-based value of NFTs and raised the cost of buying and
selling them, in what could be a setback for the burgeoning digital
asset market. But NFT collectors are not bailing out.

Non-fungible tokens - a way of trading digital assets by recording their
ownership status on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) - exploded in popularity in February and
March this year, notching up hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

The sudden boom is partly attributed to 2020’s crypto price surge; NFTs
are usually bought with the cryptocurrency ether or dollars.

But the crypto market hit a roadblock on Wednesday when as much as $1
trillion was wiped off the global crypto complex and prices for ether
and its larger cousin [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) fell 30%-40%.

NFT prices are normally listed on marketplaces in ether, meaning sellers
may adjust prices higher to keep them constant in dollars. But with
ether still trading a third off recent record highs, NFT values in
dollars will have fallen sharply.

A collector who goes by the pseudonym “Pranksy” said his cryptocurrency
portfolio’s worth dropped by more than $10 million at one point on
Wednesday.

But he said he did not see his collection of more than 100,000 NFTs as
less valuable because he had not sold them.

> “The people who spent many thousands on NFTs aren’t going to sell them
for 50% off tomorrow, at least not many are. Much like traditional art
markets bucking Wall Street trends I believe many see certain NFTs as a
store of value,” Pranksy told Reuters.

Enthusiasts say the artwork, virtual land, in-game items or other
digital assets the NFTs represent hold value that is distinct from the
cryptocurrencies used to buy them.

Andrew Steinwold, a Chicago-based crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who runs an NFT fund,
said, “Because everything is priced in ether, definitely ... the
valuation will be much less.”

> “But we’re a five-year fund so we’re thinking in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of years, not
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of weeks.”

The NFT frenzy was cooling even before this week. Data from OpenSea,
which says it is the largest marketplace for NFT trading, shows April
sales at $93.6 million, down from almost $150 million in March.

## GAS PRICES

As cryptocurrencies fell, the NFT market was hit from so-called “gas”
fees - the payment made to the crypto miners who carry out the
transaction on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

On Wednesday, gas prices spiked as demand to buy and sell ether
increased. That caused NFT liquidity to dry up as buyers may have
delayed transactions to save on gas fees, Pranksy said.

On OpenSea, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volumes fell to $1.1 million on Wednesday compared
with $2 million on Tuesday, as “gas prices made lower-priced items
tricky to purchase,” said Hamish Barnes, OpenSea’s growth and community
lead.

NFT sales volume on the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) was $19,687,241 on
Wednesday, up from $15,637,693 the day before, according to
NonFungible.com, a site which tracks NFT market activity.

The number of sales was lower, at 2,462 on Wednesday compared to 4,113
on Tuesday.

NonFungible.com co-founder Gauthier Zuppinger said the NFT market was
increasingly de-correlated with the crypto market.

> “I don’t think we’ll see a direct impact on the NFT space right now or
in the next few days,” Zuppinger said, adding that crypto-rich [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
could even see NFTs as less risky than cryptocurrencies “because they
are backed by the use-case”.

Nifty Gateway, an NFT marketplace owned by Gemini, said there was no
visible change in behaviour on the platform during the cryptocurrency
volatility.

> “Our collectors typically have an affinity for digital art, so they
buy and hold their NFTs,” a spokeswoman said.
