LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s wild ride this week is far from
unusual for the largest crypto token - but the rollercoaster is also its
inherent contradiction.

Speculators betting for years on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) becoming a stateless digital
currency that’s widely used for online retail and payments are largely
responsible for its parabolic price rises. But they also seed the sort
of blinding volatility that makes that ambition almost untenable.

Bitcoin’s 30% plunge on Tuesday after another Chinese government
crackdown is not unique. Daily moves of more than 20% have been frequent
during the past 6 years. At almost 4.5%, median [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price swings over
that time period are more than 6 times that of the main Transatlantic
euro/dollar exchange rate.

And while some online retailers might accept [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as payment for
goods priced in dollars, few could manage the potential accounting chaos
of sticker pricing in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) if its value can routinely shift by a
fifth in just hours.

The flipside is true for buyers. If you think [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price keeps on
rising over time - much like the latest quadrupling over the past 12
months - then why would you surrender those gains by paying for anything
with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) today?

And so if that role as a transaction currency or stable store of value
remains elusive, it’s essentially just a game of hoarding a finite
number of tokens by small groups of people that routinely involves wild,
illiquid swings whenever regulators pounce, backers tweet support or big
players cash in.

As ever, arguments about pros and cons of crypto tokens divide among
believers and non-believers - blind faith versus instant dismissal,
cheer-leading versus scorn.

Deutsche Bank this week likened [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) belief structures to the so-
called “Tinkerbell effect” - a theory drawing from childrens’ book
character Peter Pan’s claim that the fairy only exists because the kids
believe she does.

> “In other words, the value of Bitcoin is entirely based on wishful
thinking,” wrote Deutsche analyst Marion Laboure.

Laboure estimates that less than 30% of transactions in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) are
currently related to payments - the rest is trading, speculation,
investment or related activities.

And she reckons its liquidity as an investment asset is low. With about
28 million [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s changing hands last year, that’s 150% of all those
in circulation - almost half the equivalent metric for Apple shares.

## TINKERBELL, ARK AND MUSK

With a market capitalisation still about $1 trillion, governments can’t
ignore [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), even if central banks continue to dismiss its wider
systemic importance. They may even welcome the fact its emergence over
the past decade has spurred so-called “fintech” innovation as they
gradually develop their own central bank digital currencies over the
coming years.

But Deutsche’s Laboure reckons more crackdowns will come - and most
likely the whenever [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) even looks like rivalling their currencies
for payment.

> “It is no surprise that governments are not inclined to give up their
monetary monopolies. Throughout [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), governments first regulate and
then take ownership.”

If so, what’s the endgame of all the speculation and hoarding - which
just further limits [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) supply and drives the price higher? Is it
just “pass the parcel” while the music keeps playing? Or are people with
money to burn punting for quick gains and trading strategically by
timing entry and exits?

Some argue there is genuine demand for crypto transfers within the half
trillion dollars per year of global remittances, as migrant workers
often need to funnel money back to poorer countries with strict formal
exchange controls.

Others claim crypto privacy features draw in demand from criminals, as
per this month’s ransomeware hack at Colonial pipeline. But that will
just hasten more [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/). Investment arguments beyond simply punting
it ever higher range from a lack of “correlation” with other assets to a
potential role as an inflation hedge - an odd assertion given its latest
reversal comes amid all the post-pandemic inflation scares.

Powerful backers have a outsize say too, but are increasingly erratic.

Tesla billionaire Elon Musk drove the price skywards earlier this year
by saying Tesla would accept [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s as payment for its dollar-priced
electric vehicle and add [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to the company balance sheet - only to
backtrack last week by warning about excessive energy usage in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
mining.

With no obvious rationale, star tech stock [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Cathie Wood of Ark
Invest claimed this week that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would rise another tenfold again
after it registered a 50% loss in a month.

At the $500,000 level she posits, the market cap of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would then
be $10 trillion - or a third of the entire M1 money supply of G20
economies.

London School of Economics’ Jon Danielsson reckons that as a result of
the concentration of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) ownership, that sort of move would create
new multi billionaires - or even the first trillionaire. And that would
wildly exaggerate existing wealth skews as the gap between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) haves
and have-nots soars to intolerable levels, making a mockery of claims of
crypto “democratisation”.

As a result, he thinks co-existence of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and so-called fiat
currencies is impossible. It’s all or nothing.

If it replaces all G20 currencies in circulation, that would then see
each [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) priced at $1.5 million.

Reality or fiction?

> “Bitcoin is a bubble,” Danielsson concludes. “It makes sense to ride
the bubble as long as possible – just get out in time.”
