Cryptocurrency market indicators such as average [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) funding rates,
inflows into crypto investment products and the ratio of old-to-new
coins being sold suggest a near-term consolidation for the sector and
lower odds of a year-end rally [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bulls are predicting.

Bitcoin rose 1.6% on Friday to $57,850.56 but was on track for weekly
losses of over 11%, its worst week since May. It is 16% lower than its
Nov. 10 record high of $69,000. Ether , the second-biggest
cryptocurrency by market value, was 14% off of its peak at $4,202.45.

Market participants cited profit-taking after [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) hit those highs,
its increasing sensitivity to global inflation expectations and
regulatory headwinds as behind the week's declines.

Concerns that creditors of Mt Gox, a crypto exchange that collapsed in
2014, could liquidate their [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-denominated repayments also weighed
on sentiment.

In the past week, traders have become less willing to pay to hold long
positions in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures. Average funding rates, a barometer for
sentiment in the perpetual swaps market, have fallen to around 0.008%,
according to cryptocurrency analytics platform CryptoQuant, their lowest
since early October.

Positive funding rates imply that traders are bullish, as they must pay
to hold a long position.

> "Do we set new highs before the end of the year? I'd say we've come a
long way," said Paul Eisma, head of trading at crypto firm XBTO Group in
New York, adding he expected [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to trade between $53,000 and
$57,000 for the rest of the year.

Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade over the weekend, its first major update since
2017 that enables its [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) to execute more complex transactions,
was well telegraphed and largely priced in as the asset rallied into the
event, market experts said.

There is also increased spending of older coins -- associated with long-
term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exiting their positions -- though it remains small in
relative magnitude, according to [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data provider Glassnode.

A ratio between short-term and long-term [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) holders signaled stable
equilibrium between 1-week and 1-year old coins, meaning a balanced
distribution between newer and older, "smart money" [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
indicating a likely period of consolidation. Tops in price are typically
established when large volumes of coins are held by newer [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Crypto product inflows have also been subdued in the year's second half,
averaging $750 million [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) versus $960 million in the first, data from
digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday.

Still, crypto investment products attracted $151 million in investments
last week in their 13th consecutive week of inflows, and total product
inflows for the year so far have hit a record $9 billion, according to
CoinShares.

> "It alludes to the fact that we're also not overheated at the 60K
market. There's still a good way to go," Justin d'Anethan, institutional
sales manager at crypto trading firm EQONEX wrote in a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter.

ALTCOINS FALTER

The wider Nasdaq crypto index, which tracks popular digital assets such
as Litecoin, in addition to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether, was on track for weekly
declines of 9.8%.

Among so-called "meme coins," dogecoin, created as a joke for early
crypto adopters and which has surged over 4,000% this year, was up 2.5%
at $0.23 on the day, according to CoinGecko, while recently popular
Shiba Inu dropped about 17% over the past 7 days.

The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.7
trillion as per CoinGecko, down from a peak of over $3 trillion.
