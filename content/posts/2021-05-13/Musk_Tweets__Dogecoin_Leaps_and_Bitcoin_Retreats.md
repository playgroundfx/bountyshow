LONDON/SINGAPORE — Bitcoin was heading on Friday for its worst week
since February, while dogecoin leapt by a quarter, as the latest tweets
on cryptocurrencies from Tesla boss Elon Musk sent the digital coins on
a wild ride.

Bitcoin is down about 13% this week, and was last up 1.6% at $50,503. It
has slumped over a fifth from its record of just under $65,000 hit last
month.

Cryptocurrency markets have gyrated to Musk tweets for months, with his
comments on dogecoin – a token started as a joke that has scant
practical use – fueling a hundred-fold rally this year.

Musk knocked [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) this week after tweeting that Tesla would stop
accepting it for payment owing to environmental concerns.

> “Toppy markets (are) looking for an excuse to breathe,” said Ben
Sebley of crypto firm BCB Group. “Long money doesn’t care about Elon’s
tweets. Fast money trades around that stuff now.”

$68 BILLION MARKET CAP

Dogecoin has climbed about 25% after Musk’s latest tweet, according to
CoinGecko, and was last at $0.52, down from its record $0.73 hit last
week.

> “Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency.
Potentially promising,” Musk wrote on Thursday. He called it a “hustle”
last week, knocking its price.

It was unclear if Musk was referring to efficiency in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of energy,
ease of use or suitability as a currency, said Mark Humphery-Jenner,
associate professor of finance at the University of New South Wales.

Dogecoin consumes 0.12 kilowatt hours of electricity per transaction
compared with 707 for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), according to data center provider TRG.

The token, whose logo features a Shiba Inu dog, has surged this year to
become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a total value of $68
billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Few major companies accept Dogecoin for payment, and its supply is
unlimited.

In contrast, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s gains this year have been fueled by growing
mainstream adoption for payment, as well as a store of value given its
limited supply.

> “Dogecoin remains a lesson in greater fool theory,” said David
Kimberley, analyst at investing app Freetrade, which posits that buying
overpriced assets can be profitable, so long as there is a “greater
fool” to buy them.
