HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchange operator Huobi Group has
launched an investment arm with $100 million to spend, setting aside
some cash specifically for non fungible tokens, the latest hot trend,
the company said on Thursday.

The recent surge in prices for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies has
fuelled a global rush of fundraising by companies operating in the
sector, with both traditional venture capital firms and cryptocurrency
incumbents competing fiercely to snap up the best companies.

The new unit is the latest move by Huobi, the parent company of one of
the world’s largest exchanges for trading cryptocurrencies, to diversify
its operations away from trading, after a separate unit, Huobi Tech,
launched crypto-related funds for institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s last month.

The fund plans to acquire [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) companies that can be integrated
into Huobi’s existing businesses, making early stage venture capital
investments. It includes $10 million specifically for investing in NFTs
and marketplaces that trade them.

NFTs, virtual assets that exist on a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) ledger, have exploded in
popularity this year. This week, Ebay said it would allow the sale of
NFTs on its platform.

> “What we see in the market today is only a fraction of what’s actually
possible with NFTs,” said Huobi Group CFO Lily Zhang, who will head up
the new Huobi Ventures unit.
