The crypto market has again surpassed $2 trillion, adding almost 2.7% in
the last 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has not kept pace with the rise
in altcoin prices: BTC strengthened by 1.45% against a 4% rise in ETH,
while other leading coins added between 3% and 7%.

The purchase of altcoins has intensified after the first cryptocurrency
defended the $40K mark. This was like a sign of faith in the sector’s
short-term prospects, which again allowed enthusiasts to invest in
potentially more undervalued coins and projects.

The crypto Fear and Greed Index added 1 point to 22 overnight, but we
can see that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s took the recent plunge as a buying opportunity.
On the chart, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rebounded from a psychologically important support
level for the second time since September. In addition, the RSI
indicator on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts came out of the oversold area, signalling
a pause in the bearish momentum.

However, it is too early to say that we are seeing the beginning of a
new growth wave. There are several reasons for that.  
In this wave of decline, the RSI indicator reached lower lows than
earlier in December and markedly lower levels in September and July,
marking more persistent and prolonged selling than in previous episodes.

Bitcoin’s consolidation attempts this week is only a wobble near the
bottom. A bullish reversal will be indicated by solid upward momentum in
July or September. The mini rebound in December was quickly eaten away
by the bears.

BTCUSD is consolidating near the lower boundary of the descending
channel. To say that we see more than just a bounce within this trend is
only possible if it grew above 45k – where the previous local lows and
the downside resistance line are concentrated.

If [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) fails to develop an uptrend, it will seriously spoil
sentiment for cryptocurrency traders, creating a toxic environment in
the sector and putting selling back on the agenda, despite the prospects
of individual projects.
