On Monday, we saw colourful confirmation of how much stock market
dynamics are affecting Ether and Bitcoin. Following the intraday fall of
more than 2% in the Nasdaq, the top two cryptocurrencies surrendered
their psychologically important levels, retreating at $ 3K and $ 40K,
respectively.

However, in all cases, the fall was redeemed. The Nasdaq closed with a
nominal decline, and Bitcoin very quickly returned to levels near $ 42K.
Ether is currently trading at 3100, gaining over 1% since the start of
the day.

The broader technical picture has not changed, indicating locally
oversold, which puts buyers on the run who have been waiting for a
discount in recent days.

The crypto market has been losing 0.6% over the past 24 hours, but since
the beginning of the day, it has been adding 1.6% to $ 1.96 trillion
against the dip to $ 1.86 trillion at the peak of the decline on Monday
evening.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index lost 2 points in a day, dropping
to 21. This is still in extreme fear, just like yesterday and a week
ago.

In our opinion, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether are bought locally by enthusiasts and
a number of long-term strategic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, while investment funds trade
them based on bursts of demand or risk aversion.

By and large, this puts cryptocurrencies on a par with growth stocks,
sensitive to the dynamics of interest rates: the rise in profitability
causes a sell-off of risks. At the same time, we must not forget that
cryptocurrencies are more mobile, that is, they sometimes lose twice or
three times more than Nasdaq. If so, then cryptocurrencies are far from
the bottom since the process of normalizing interest rates in financial
markets is far from complete.
