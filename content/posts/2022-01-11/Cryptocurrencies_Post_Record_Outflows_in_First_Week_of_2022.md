NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency investment products and
funds had net outflows last week totaling a record $207 million, a
report from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday, as prices
continued their tumble in the first trading week of the year.

The sector has experienced four consecutive weeks of outflows since mid-
December, reaching a total of $465 million, or 0.8% of total assets
under management.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market
capitalization, posted outflows of $107 million in the week to Jan. 7.

CoinShares investment strategist James Butterfill said the outflows were
a "direct response to the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes
which revealed the U.S. Federal Reserve's concerns for rising inflation
and the fear amongst [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of an interest rate hike."

A [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening by the Fed is a negative factor for risk assets such
as cryptocurrencies because of tighter liquidity conditions and
increased market volatility.

Over the last four weeks, Coinshares noted there has been greater
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) activity than usual.

Since the start of the year, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has shed nearly 10% of its value
against the U.S. dollar. On Monday, it fell below $40,000 for the first
time since September 2021 .

> "A phase of heavy loss realization by top buyers has followed the Dec.
4 flush-out (in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/))," said [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data provider Glassnode, in
its latest research report on Monday.

>

> "In the weeks since, onchain behavior has been more heavily dominated
by the HODLer (long-term holders) class, with little activity by newer
market entrants," it added.

Ethereum-based products had outflows of $39 million last week, posting
five straight weeks of outflows with a total of $200 million. CoinShares
said on a proportional basis, Ethereum's outflows were 1.4% of total
AUM, higher than that of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Blockchain-linked equity investment products did not escape the negative
sentiment for the sector, with outflows of $10 million last week.

Assets under management at Grayscale and CoinShares, the world's two
largest digital asset managers, fell from their highs to $38.2 billion
and $4.3 billion, respectively.
