BTC was down 1.1% on Tuesday, ending the day near $47,400, and has been
remaining close to that level on Wednesday morning. Ethereum lost 0.5%,
while other leading altcoins from the top ten fell in price, from -0.8%
(Binance Coin) to -4.1% (XRP). The only exception was Terra ( 7%), which
reached its all-time high.

According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market decreased by 0.7% over the day to $2.13 trillion. The Bitcoin
dominance index remained at 42.1%.

The Cryptocurrency Index of Fear and Greed for Wednesday is down 1 point
to 55, but still is in greed territory.  
Bitcoin slowed down ahead of strong resistance at $48,000, near which
the 200-day moving average also lies. The bulls are taking a tactical
breather after the 28% rally from the lows seen on March 14th. At the
same time, the positive mood on the global stock markets sets up that we
will already see a test of this important level today.

The FxPro Analyst Team mentioned that now we will see the return of the
bullish trend only after a couple of days of confident growth above the
200-day Moving Average. But even then, many participants may still have
doubts about the rally since, in December, under similar conditions, it
was not possible to develop an offensive.

According to CryptoQuant, Crypto whales have started sending [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to
exchanges again, which is a wake-up call. Typically, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s send
cryptocurrencies back to the exchanges for their subsequent sale.
CryptoQuant does not exclude that BTC will move to an active decline in
the near future. However, the sale of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s can also take place to
buy altcoins, which are growing stronger than the first cryptocurrency
in the bull market.

DataDash CEO Nicholas Merten believes that short-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
traders with leverage influence the volatility of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and “whales”
influence the growth. In his opinion, crypto whales have been buying up
BTC over the past six months.

CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, plans to create his own open-source social
network with support for the DOGE cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Biden
administration has proposed tightening tax reporting rules for
cryptocurrency holders.
