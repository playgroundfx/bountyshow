Grayscale notes that long term holders are increasingly dominating the
Bitcoin markets over short-term speculators, driving demand relative to
supply. A new report by crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments argues
that the current Bitcoin (BTC) market structure “parallels that of early
2016 before it began its historic bull run.”

Grayscale predicts that demand for Bitcoin will significantly grow as
inflation accelerates, highlighting the need for a scarce monetary
commodity, bolstering the use-case of the cryptocurrency. The report
identifies several on-chain indicators showing growing interest in
crypto, noting an increase in long-term holding over short-term
speculation, amid historic lows for the number of Bitcoin held on
exchanges.

The report asserts that loosening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) from the United
States’ abandonment of the gold standard onwards have created cycles of
debt-fuelled asset bubbles followed by aggressive quantitative easing.
Grayscale notes the increasing dependence of the U.S. economy on
quantitative easing (money printing) to stay afloat and that [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
shows it’s an addiction difficult to quit. The S&P dropped 20% over
three months in response to the Federal Reserve floating plans to
reverse its monetary expansion in 2018.

Grayscale also notes that [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) active addresses are at their highest
level since 2017’s all-time highs. The report asserts that loosening
