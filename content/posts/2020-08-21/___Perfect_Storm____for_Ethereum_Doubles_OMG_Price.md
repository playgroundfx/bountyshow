The native token for OMG Network has more than doubled in the past week
as record Ethereum fees lead some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to look to layer 2
solutions. CoinGecko data shows OMG tokens have increased 115% from
$1.70 to $3.65 in the past seven days – with the price surging by 30% in
the past 24 hours.

The rally means OMG’s market cap has surged by approximately $275
million since this time last week. OMG’s price has increased by nearly
1,000% since it fell to its all-time low of $0.35 after the Black
Thursday crash in March.

Denis Vinokourov, research head at crypto exchange BeQuant, told
CoinDesk OMG Network was benefitting from a “perfect storm” of industry-
wide developments. The craze around DeFi – a subset that has exploded to
well over $6 billion – has seen a surge in activity on Ethereum, leading
to soaring fees.

There are also reports the testnet for Eth 2.0 – a new iteration that
would make the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) platform much more scalable – crashed last
week. As such, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are beginning to look more closely at layer 2
solutions, he said.

Ethereum’s average transaction fees rapidly shot up from under $0.10 in
January to nearly $3.40 currently – the first time fees have stayed so
consistently high.

Stablecoin Tether – a notable “gas guzzler” – said Wednesday it was
launching on OMG Network so it could take some of the pressure off the
base layer.
