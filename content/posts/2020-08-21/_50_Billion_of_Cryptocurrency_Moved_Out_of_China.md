Over $50 billion of cryptocurrency moved from China-based digital
wallets to other parts of the world in the last year, pointing to
possibilities that Chinese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are transferring more money than
allowed out of the country, a new report claims.

![$50 Billion of Cryptocurrency Moved Out of China][1]

Chinese citizens are only allowed to buy up to $50,000 of foreign
currency a year at a financial institution. In the past, wealthy
citizens have circumvented the limit through foreign investments in real
estate and other assets. But the government has cracked down on these
methods, according to a report by Chainalysis, a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) forensics
firm.

> “Cryptocurrency could be picking up some of the slack though,” the
report said. “Over the last twelve months, with China’s economy
suffering due to trade wars and devaluation of the yuan at different
points, we’ve seen over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from
China-based addresses to overseas addresses,” Chainalysis said.

Cryptocurrency holders are using controversial stablecoin Tether to move
their money. A stablecoin is a digital currency that is usually backed
by another asset or group of assets in efforts to stabilize its value
and limit volatility. Tether claims to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Stablecoins are useful for transferring large amounts of cryptocurrency
because, in theory, the value of the cryptocurrency a person is moving
should not see wild swings.

> “In total, over $18 billion worth of Tether has moved from East Asia
addresses to those based in other regions over the last 12 months.
Again, it’s highly unlikely that all of this is capital flight,”
Chainalysis said in its report.

But the report also found significant spikes in Tether movement on
certain [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) events. Firstly, in October, Chinese President Xi Jinping
threw his backing behind [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), the technology that underpins many
digital coins.

Secondly, after a massive sell-off in mid-March, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
began to recover.

> “Equities in both the U.S. and China were still losing value at this
time, as was the yuan itself. It’s possible that the economic tumult may
have prompted some capital flight from China, though much of the Tether
movement could have been East Asia-based cryptocurrency traders moving
their holdings to international exchanges in order to trade at a time
when [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) volatility was high,” Chainalysis said.
