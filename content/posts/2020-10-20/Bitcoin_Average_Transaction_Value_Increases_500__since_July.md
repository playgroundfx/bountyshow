The average value of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions has increased
dramatically since July this year. The average transaction value was
sitting at approximately $25,000 per transaction four months ago, but
posted a yearly high on Oct 20 at $151,000 per transfer — representing
an increase of more than 500%. The latest spike, as shown by crypto
analytics platform BitInfoCharts’ data, saw the average value of a
transaction increase almost $50,000, up from $105,000, in the last 48
hours. This surge in transaction value comes shortly after Bitcoin’s
trading dominance rose to levels not seen since 2017.

The $151,000 average value is 190 times more than Ethereum’s average
transaction value of $793, suggesting a significantly greater
institutional presence in the Bitcoin markets. However, the number of
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Ethereum transactions increased by 30% amid the DeFi boom in
August, reaching a 2-year high of 1.29 million on Aug 10. Over the same
period, Bitcoin transactions consistently hovered between 300k and 350k,
suggesting the Ethereum ecosystem was the primary magnet for new crypto
users. The number of Bitcoin active addresses also showed no significant
changes, fluctuating between 650k and 970K over the last 4 months.

By the end of September, Grayscale controlled at least 449,900 BTC or
2.4% of the current supply of Bitcoin, and Microstrategy owned 38,250
BTC. Two weeks later, Jack Dorsey’s Square purchased 4,709 BTC
(approximately $50 million) in Bitcoin.
