Cryptocurrencies extended gains in Asia on Tuesday, with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) reaching record highs, in the wake of a Tesla Inc investment in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Bitcoin posted its largest [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) percentage gain in more than three
years overnight, after Tesla made the announcement in its 2020 annual
report.

Bitcoin added as much as 2.5% to hit a record high of $47,565.86 on
Tuesday and has gained 61% for the year so far. Ethereum hit a record of
$1,784.
