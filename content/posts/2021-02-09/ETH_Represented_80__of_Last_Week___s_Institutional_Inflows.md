Crypto asset manager CoinShares has reported that investment inflows
into institutional cryptocurrency funds surged last week, and the
majority of it was Ethereum. The report states that of the $245 million
crypto inflow last week, 80% of it or $195 million was invested into
Ether products ahead of the launch of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Ethereum futures contracts on Feb. 8. Comparatively, Bitcoin had $41.9
million of the weekly flows, with a year-to-date total of $2.02 billion.
The report suggested that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) diversification was starting to
occur, adding that there was little evidence of taking profits with
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferring to buy and hold.

The report stated that investment product trading volumes remain high,
averaging $670 million per day last week — representing 5.4% of total
Bitcoin trading volumes. Grayscale remains the largest institutional
crypto asset fund with a record $33.4 billion in assets under management
(AUM) as of Feb. 8. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust has been growing in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of the total share of the AUM figure and has now reached over $5 billion
which equates to over 15%. The Bitcoin Trust still contains the lion’s
share of all investments, however, with 82% of the total.

CoinShares reports that 21Shares is the second-largest institutional
fund by weekly inflows with almost $21 million, followed by WisdomTree
with $11.5 million. Many pundits expected the launch of CME’s Ether
futures would be followed by a sharp crash to repeat the collapse in
prices that followed the launch of Bitcoin futures in December 2017.
However, Ethereum rallied after contracts launched, posting a new all-
time high of $1,780 on Feb. 9. ETH last changed hands for $1,750 at the
time of writing.
