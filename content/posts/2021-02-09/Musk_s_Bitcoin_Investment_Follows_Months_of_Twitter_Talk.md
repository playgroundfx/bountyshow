Feb 8 (Reuters) - Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment unveiled on
Monday may not surprise CEO Elon Musk’s followers on Twitter, where he
has shown himself as a major proponent of the soaring cryptocurrency.

The announcement of Tesla’s investment, buried in Tesla’s 2020 annual
report, follows months of tweets by Musk related to cryptocurrencies
including Bitcoin, sometimes helping fuel its rally.

The cryptocurrency jumped 10% on Monday following Tesla’s disclosure.

In a December exchange on Twitter, Musk asked MicroStrategy CEO Michael
Saylor, who recommended Tesla buy Bitcoin, about the possibility of
“large transactions” to convert some of Tesla’s balance shit to the
cryptocurrency.

Saylor is a Bitcoin bull and his software company has bought around
41,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s, currently worth close to $1.7 billion. MicroStrategy’s
stock jumped 18% on Monday, bringing its gain in 2021 to 146% as traders
view it as a play on Bitcoin.

Replying in May to a tweet by author J.K. Rowling about Bitcoin, Musk
wrote that massive debt taken on by central banks made Bitcoin more
attractive. He added that he owned only a quarter of a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which
was trading below $10,000 at the time.

Last month, Musk added “#Bitcoin” to his Twitter profile, sparking a 14%
surge in the digital currency, and in December he tweeted, “Bitcoin is
my safe word.”

Driven in part by interest from institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the price of
Bitcoin has quadrupled since in the past four months, surging far beyond
record highs set in 2017. Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s view it a hedge against
inflation.

Tesla also said in its filing it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of
payment.

In chat on social media app Clubhouse that drew thousands of listeners
earlier this month, Musk said Bitcoin was “on the verge” of being more
widely accepted among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
