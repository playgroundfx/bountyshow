Last week, BTC repeated the dynamics of the first ten days of February.
The rate strengthened on Monday-Tuesday, and on Wednesday, it exceeded
the level of $44,800. Then on Thursday, the price began to fall sharply
in unison with stock indices. The decrease in risky assets was caused by
the growing tension around Ukraine, where the situation is becoming
tenser.

On Friday, Bitcoin continued to fall, briefly dropping below the round
level of $40,000. This mark was broken on Sunday, and BTC tested the
next support level at $38,000. The situation is aggravated by the
increase in cryptocurrency sales by miners. As a result, the bears may
try to push the price to $36,000 and even $33,000.

We must say that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has lost all the growth of February over the
past week. In addition to the upcoming Fed rate hike, BTC has been hit
by growing geopolitical risks.

In addition to this, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, noted
that he sees early signs of the onset of crypto winter. This spurred
crypto sales among retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s over the weekend. However, ETHUSD is
up 5.3% on Monday, recouping Sundayâ€™s decline and continuing to struggle
to close the third month in the red.

Overall, Bitcoin was down 9.2% over the past week, ending it at around
$38,300. Ethereum lost 9.7%, other leading altcoins from the top ten
also sank: from 3.3% (Avalanche) to 11% (Cardano).

The total capitalization of the crypto market fell by 7% in a week, to
$1.82 trillion. The Bitcoin dominance index fell 0.7% to 40%, due to
less weakening of altcoins. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index lost
another 2 points to 25 on Monday, returning to the extreme fear
territory.
