At the start of Monday, Bitcoin’s price temporarily fell below $42K,
losing more than 3.5% from Sunday’s peak value. This is clear evidence
of a tug-of-war between bullish retail traders and professional bidders
who sold risky assets in response to pressure on stock prices.

![Bitcoin can Retreat to March Lows Following the Stocks][1]

In total, BTC has been losing 1% over the past 24 hours and 8.5% over
the week. Ethereum is down 2% and 9% in the last 7 days, and top
altcoins fell in price by 1.3% (Dogecoin) and up to 7.4% (Terra).

According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market decreased by 2% to 1.95B in a day. This clearly reflects the
increased pressure on weaker altcoins due to the curtailment of risk
demand. The share of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in the capitalization of the entire crypto
market is now 41.3% ( 0.6 points in 7 days and 0.3 in a day).

By the start of the day on Monday, the crypto-currency fear and greed
index had lost 2 points to 32, settling in the fear territory.

The crypto market is again increasing its correlation with the dynamics
of stocks, or rather, it is guided by the high-tech Nasdaq index. This
relationship is easily explained by the fact that in both cases,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are betting on a progressive idea and not on a stable income.

The original plan, in which cryptocurrencies would become an alternative
haven for capital outside of the traditional banking system, has not
been tested by the military events in Ukraine. As it turns out, crypto
exchanges value the idea of legally earning commissions on transactions
and on the placement of tokens much more than the original off-system
and apolitical approach.

Thus, the cryptocurrency market is increasingly becoming a platform for
the assets of ever-smaller projects in the technology sector. There is
nothing wrong with this in the long run, but right now, such a direct
correlation with stocks can do a disservice. Against the backdrop of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), stocks are under increased pressure. Amid
deteriorating sentiment, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dropped to a 50-day moving average near
$42K. Fixing below this level may open a direct path to the area of
March lows near $38K.
