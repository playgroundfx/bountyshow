Crypto market capitalization has risen marginally, up 0.7% over the past
seven days, showing a decline since mid-Thursday. The rebound in the
crypto market after the collapse early last week is drying up.

The cryptocurrency Greed and Fear Index was up to 50 on Thursday, having
fallen to 48 at the time of writing. Being in the middle of the range,
it does not give any overbought signals, leaving room for a moderate
decline further down.

Bitcoin has failed to latch on to levels above $48K. Developing pressure
on the price of the first cryptocurrency from current levels will
confirm a downtrend, with sharp selling starting from increasingly lower
levels. In April, these were values near $60K. In May, buyers
speculators capitulated, failing to push the price above $55K. In
September, it did not even manage to stay above $50K for long.

The short-term pressures are the quarterly futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
expiration, with the greatest concentration near $50K, which the bears
are now fiercely defending.

Short-term traders should keep their focus on the $45K level. A drop
under could trigger a capitulation in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) – a fire that could
quickly spread throughout the entire crypto market.

The pressure on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), however, is not limited to technical or
speculative factors alone. S&P500 warned El Salvador of “immediate
negative implications for it credit rating”, which officially made
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) a payment instrument alongside the dollar last week. S&P said
such action could deprive the country of IMF aid programs and increase
vulnerabilities for its banking and fiscal systems.

Such [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) worsens the perception of cryptocurrencies among institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, who have been the main driving force behind [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) this
year.

For ether, the short-term turning point was the $3600 mark, the crossing
of which attracted sellers, who have dominated the market so far,
dropping the price to $3450. The attention here is worth paying
attention to the $3000. A sustained fall below for the top altcoin risk
triggers a sell-off across most of the crypto market.

The failure of top coins below 45k for BTC and 3k for ETH will reinforce
the current situation from 2018 when a failed attempt to rewrite
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs turned into a crypto winter that not all altcoins
survived. Most worryingly, for cryptocurrencies driven by interest
alone, this could prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
