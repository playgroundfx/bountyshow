Jan 14 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will accept meme-based cryptocurrency
dogecoin as payment for its merchandise such as the "Giga Texas" belt
buckle and mini models of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Officer
Elon Musk said in a tweet on Friday.

The move, which sent dogecoin prices 14% higher, comes a month after
Musk said Tesla would test out the digital token as a payment option.

Musk, a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, has heavily influenced
prices of dogecoin and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and at one point had said the company
would accept [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) for purchasing its cars before axing plans.

Tesla's merchandise, which also include the recently launched
"Cyberwhistle" and "Cyberquad for Kids", are a hit with its fans, and
usually sell out within a few hours of listing.

> "Some have noted that goods for doge are selling out even faster than
for dollars. This [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is a good illustration of crypto's continued
penetration of corporate culture," said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior
financial analyst at FxPro.

Musk's tweets on dogecoin, including the one where he called it the
"people's crypto", have turned the once-obscure digital currency, which
began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream. The token's
price surged by about 4,000% in 2021.

Tesla disclosed last year it had bought $1.5 billion worth of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
and Musk has also said he owns some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and dogecoin.

Tesla is facing intense competition as legacy automakers such as Ford
Motor Co as well as startups including Rivian Automotive are set to
launch their electric cars this year.

Tesla's much-awaited Cybertruck will begin production in the first
quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to start production in late 2022,
Reuters reported.
