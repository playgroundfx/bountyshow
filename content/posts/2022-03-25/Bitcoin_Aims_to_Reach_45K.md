The current values of BTC are consolidating in the area of 2-month
extremes. In contrast to the previous test of these levels, this time,
we see a smooth rise in the rate, indicating that the bulls still have
some momentum.

Also over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has gained 2.4%, while other
leading altcoins from the top ten have strengthened from 0.5% (XRP) to
7.4% (Solana). The exception is Terra, which is shedding 1.8%,
correcting part of its gains in the first half of the week.

According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization
increased by 2.3% to $2 trillion. The Bitcoin Dominance Index rose 0.1
percentage points to 41.8%. The Fear and Greed Cryptocurrency Index
added another 7 points to 47 and ended up in the neutral territory.

Cardano leads the last week in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of growth among top coins ( 39%) as
Coinbase added the possibility of staking cryptocurrency with a current
estimated annual return of 3.75% per annum.

Credit Suisse reported that Bitcoin doesn’t pose a threat to the banking
sector as an alternative to fiat money and banking services.

The CEO of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment companies,
noted that military actions in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia will
increase the popularity of cryptocurrencies and accelerate their
adoption.

Despite the rally in global stocks over the past two weeks, financial
conditions in the debt markets continue to deteriorate due to rising
interest rates and inflation. Largely because of this, El Salvador has
postponed the issuance of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bonds in anticipation of more
favourable conditions. Since very active steps to raise key rates are
expected in the next year and a half, and Bitcoin is far from the highs,
it is unlikely that such bonds will be issued soon.

The Bank of England intends to tighten supervision of cryptocurrencies
due to the financial risks that their adoption carries. However, the
Central Bank urged commercial banks to exercise maximum caution when
dealing with these extremely volatile assets.
