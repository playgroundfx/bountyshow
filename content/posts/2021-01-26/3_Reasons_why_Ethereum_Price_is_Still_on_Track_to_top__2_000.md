After dropping 27% over three days, Ether (ETH) price finally reached a
bottom at $1,040 on Jan. 22. The sharp correction liquidated $600
billion worth of future contracts but interestingly, Ether price
rebounded to a new all-time high even as Bitcoin price continues to
trade in a slight downtrend.

According to Cointelegraph, the increasing TVL and transaction volumes
of the decentralized finance sector are behind Ether’s impressive surge.
To determine whether the recent pump reflects a potential local top,
we’ll take a closer look at on-chain flows and derivatives data.

Exchange withdrawals point to whale accumulation  
Increasing withdrawals from exchanges can be caused by multiple factors,
including staking, yield farming, and buyers sending coins to cold
storage. Usually, a steady flow of net deposits indicate a willingness
to sell in the short-term. On the other hand, net withdrawals are
generally related to periods of whale accumulation.

Futures were overbought  
By measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot
market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market. The
3-month futures should usually trade with a 6% to 20% annualized premium
(basis) versus regular spot exchanges. Whenever this indicator fades or
turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as
backwardation and indicates that the market is turning bearish. On the
other hand, a sustainable basis above 20% signals excessive leverage
from buyers, creating the potential for massive liquidations and
eventual market crashes.

The premium peaked at 6.5% on Jan. 19, equal to a 38% annualized rate.
This level is considered extremely overbought, as traders need an even
higher price increase ahead of expiration to profit from it.

Spot volume remains strong and traders bought the dip  
In addition to monitoring futures contracts, profitable traders also
track volume in the spot market. Typically, low volumes indicate a lack
of confidence. Therefore significant price increases should be
accompanied by robust trading activity.

Over the past week, Ether has averaged $6.1 billion in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume, and
while this figure is far from the $12.3 billion all-time high seen on
Jan. 11, it is still 240% higher than December’s. Therefore, the
activity supporting the recent $1,477 all-time high is a positive
indicator.
