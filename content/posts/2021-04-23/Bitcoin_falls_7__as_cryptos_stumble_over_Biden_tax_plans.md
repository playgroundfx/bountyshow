LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered
hefty losses on Friday amid fears that U.S. President Joe Biden’s plan
to raise capital gains taxes will curb investment in digital assets.

Bitcoin slumped 7% to $48,176 in a third straight session of losses
while Ether and XPR suffered double digit tumbles.

> “The crypto currency came under fresh pressure on the Biden tax
headlines,” Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, is on track for a 15% loss
on the week. However, the latest tumbles come in the wake of a sharp
rally with Bitcoin still up 65% since the start of the year.
