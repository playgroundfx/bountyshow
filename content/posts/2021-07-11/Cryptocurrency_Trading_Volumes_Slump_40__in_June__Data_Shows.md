Trading volumes at major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s fell by more than 40%
in June, research showed on Monday, with a regulatory crackdown in China
and lower volatility among the factors depressing activity.

Spot trading volumes fell 42.7% to $2.7 trillion, with derivative
volumes down 40.7% to $3.2 trillion, London-based researcher
CryptoCompare’s data showed.

> “Headwinds continued as China persisted with its crackdown on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
mining,” CryptoCompare said. “As a result of both lower prices and
volatility, spot volumes decreased.”

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell more than 6% last month,
touching its lowest since January, as authorities in China tightened
restrictions launched a month earlier on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading and mining.

It had tumbled 35% in May, with its losses sparked by Beijing’s moves to
rein in the fast-growing sector. Crypto trading volumes tend to spike
during periods of extreme price swings.

Major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Binance, which has faced scrutiny from
regulators across the world, retained its position as biggest platform
by spot trading volume, CryptoCompare said. Still, volumes at Binance
fell 56% in June to $668 billion.
