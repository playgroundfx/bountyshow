The cryptocurrency picked up bids during the Asian trading hours, rising
from $11,750 to $12,068, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. At
press time, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is trading at $12,000 – just 1% short of the 2020
high of $12,118 reached on Aug. 2. A break above $12,118 looks likely,
as bullish demand can be seen in the strong hourly volume that continues
to rise with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s hike in value. If [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) manages to surpass the
$12,118 level, the next target would be the high of $12,325 reached
early in August 2019.



![Bitcoin: a break above $12,118 looks likely][1]

Bitcoin ended last week (Sunday, UTC) at $11,683 – the highest weekly
close since January 2018 (see chart above right). That has has opened
the doors for further gains, according to some analysts. The [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
market is also skewed bullish, with call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) (bullish bets) drawing
higher prices than puts (bearish bets) on the one, three, and six-month
time frames. Crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital’s co-founder
Kyle Davies said Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem could
be another catalyst bolstering [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s recent rally.

Bitcoin, however, looks vulnerable to a potential bounce in the U.S.
dollar, having recently developed a relatively strong negative
correlation with the greenback. Bitcoin jumped from $9,100 to $12,118 in
the 13 days to Aug. 2, as the dollar index, which tracks the value of
USD against major currencies, fell from 96 to a 26-month low of 92.55.
