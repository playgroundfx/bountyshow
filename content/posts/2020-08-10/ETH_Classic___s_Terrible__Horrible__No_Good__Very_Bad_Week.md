And as the bits settle, the proof-of-work [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s future remains in
question more than ever. The first attack occurred on Aug. 1, the
network’s second ever. Five days later, a second 51% attack followed the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the first had indeed seen a successful double-spend of $5.6
million worth of ETC.

The second attack was perhaps more important, although smaller in
monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) ($1.68 million). By striking twice, the attacker proved
the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) has seemingly no ability to protect itself from
meaningful exploits. A 51% attack on a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) refers to a miner or a
group of miners trying to control more than 50% of a network’s mining
power, computing power or hash rate.

Ethereum is a hard fork of Ethereum Classic. The two chains split in
2016 in a disagreement over the value of immutability following a
compromised [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/), The DAO, causing a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) “rollback.” At
that time, Ethereum Classic developers decided to eat the attack’s
losses. The majority of Ethereum’s leadership and hashing power did not
and hard forked under the ETH ticker.

Four years later, Ethereum Classic has continued to operate in the
shadow of Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum. The smaller chain’s last few hard
forks have all but copy and pasted Ethereum’s work. Yet, the project has
differentiated itself on one point: a commitment to the Proof-of-Work
(PoW) consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin. Ethereum, on the other hand,
has slowly moved toward the novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) under the
Ethereum 2.0 project.

That technical decision is under heightened pressure. PoW coins with low
hashing power are liable to being 51% attacked. And Ethereum Classic
seems unable to do anything about it for the time being.
