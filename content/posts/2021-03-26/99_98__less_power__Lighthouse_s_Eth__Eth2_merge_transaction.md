Blockchain security provider Sigma Prime has announced its first merge
transaction between the two Ethereum networks. The transaction was made
by its Lighthouse client using only Proof of Stake validators, it stated
in a March 25 tweet. It added that this was a step towards a 99.98% drop
in Ethereum energy consumption, deriving that figure from calculations
that compare the current Proof of Work Eth1 with the much more efficient
Proof of Stake Eth2.

Sigma Prime stated that it is an exciting achievement but still far from
production as it is still a prototype with much more work to do. The
transaction is part of the initial steps towards Phase 1.5 in the
Ethereum 2.0 upgrade roadmap when a “docking” process will merge Eth1
mainnet with the Eth2 Beacon Chain and sharding system. The move to
Proof of Stake will eliminate the energy-hungry mining operations that
currently power Eth1, though the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) will still run as a shard of
Eth2 once Phase 1.5 is complete.

A discussion on mining, and its power consumption, was spawned on Reddit
in response to the Lighthouse development. Citing the increasing costs
of electricity, and graphics processors at the moment due to the global
chip shortage, Redditor HighlightAccording98 stated that it’s simpler to
profit from staking than mining.
