Bitcoin’s price reversed Wednesday’s losses on Thursday. Traders and
analysts, however, have largely kept a short-term bearish view because
some are attributing gains in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies to
GameStop’s stock drama.

![Bitcoin Reverses Wednesday’s Losses, Ether Climbs][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,607.78 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).
Gaining 3.17% over the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin’s 24-hour range:
$29,921.96-$32,934.56. BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the
hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

GameStop’s stock drama seems to be galvanizing not just stock markets
but [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies, many of which reversed their
losses of just a day ago, similar to what happened in the U.S. equities
market. The most notable winner was dogecoin (DOGE), which hit a new
all-time high earlier Thursday.

Few attribute [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price gains Thursday to market fundamentals.
That’s because the crypto community still looks to be distracted by the
GameStop (NYSE: GME) situation. A group of Redditors on a board called
WallStreetBets (WSB) sent the video game retailer’s shares skyrocketing
in order to squeeze hedge funds that were betting the stock’s price
would go down.

On the technical side, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is near short-term oversold levels, yet
momentum is still on the downside, according to Katie Stockton, managing
partner at Fairlead Strategies.

Retailer traders’ fear of missing out (FOMO) may be the big driver of
both equity and crypto markets at the moment, but it isn’t clear if new
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are buying more [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which could affect its
price.

As CoinDesk reported previously, many institutions may be pausing
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) purchases until they have further clarification on how the new
Biden Administration views [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies.
