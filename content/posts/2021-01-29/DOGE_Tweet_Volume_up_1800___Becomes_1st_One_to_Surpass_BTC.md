Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme coin created as a joke, has seen a groundswell
of Twitter activity in the past 24 hours after attention was thrown on
the coin by the now-infamous Reddit group responsible for pumping the
share price of GameStop.

Ever][1]

Dogecoin’s Twitter volume — the number of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) tweets versus the 30-day
average — skyrocketed 1,787% on Thursday, according to crypto data
provider The TIE. In total, there were 89,991 tweets about DOGE over a
24-hour period.

In fact, The TIE’s data suggests it’s the first time any altcoin has
surpassed Bitcoin in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of volume. In addition to seeing a spike in
Twitter activity, Dogecoin experienced a similar surge in trading
volume. The digital currency’s price appreciated 223% over the 24-hour
period.

The DOGE price appears to have spiked due to worldwide attention on
r/WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that successfully caught Wall Street
sellers in a short squeeze by gobbling up shares of GameStop and AMC.
Although the subreddit’s moderators have attempted to remove any
attempts to pump the DOGE price, Reddit users on other channels have
left subtle hints to invest in the cryptocurrency.

At the time of writing, DOGE was valued at $0.024 for a total market
capitalization of just under $3.1 billion. It has surpassed
cryptocurrencies Tezos, Monero and EOS following its latest spike.
