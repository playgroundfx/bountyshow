LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Bitcoin on Tuesday held ground just below
its highest this year, touched a day earlier, with gains for the
original cryptocurrency topping 27% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Bitcoin hit $48,234 on Monday evening, its highest since Dec. 31. It was
last trading up 0.9% at $47,553.

Its gains lifted smaller cryptocurrencies that tend to move in tandem
with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Ether , the second biggest token, hit $3,436 on Monday,
its highest since early January.

Market players cited emerging signs of a new wave of adoption of crypto
by institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and financial firms, whose interest over the
past two years has fuelled crypto's journey to mainstream asset from
niche technology.

Bitcoin has risen over 12% in the last week alone.

Among supportive comments cited were those by BlackRock Inc'sÂ chief
executive, who said last week that the Russia-Ukraine war could end up
accelerating digital currencies as a tool to settle international
transactions.

Such moves signal "growing conviction that the crypto markets are worth
dedicating more resources to," said Noelle Acheson, head of market
insights at U.S. crypto firm Genesis.

Though [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies are now spoken of in the same
breath as traditional assets from stocks and foreign exchange to bonds,
its remains as volatile as ever.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November, before tumbling
almost 30% in just 24 days.
