Bitcoin is trading in a 1% range with no pronounced momentum near $60K,
losing 0.5% since the start of the day but up 0.5% to levels 24 hours
ago. Cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose 1% to $2.62 trillion
overnight, adding to altcoins.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index added 2 points to 54, remaining
in neutral territory. In September and May, this shift in sentiment
contributed to a prolonged, more than a month-long slump in the
cryptocurrency market. But despite the deep correction, the market has
remained in a long-term bullish trend this year.

In 2018, the onset of crypto winter was only after BTCUSD and ETHUSD
sank below their 200-day moving averages. They are now at $48K and
$3.8K, 20% and 10% below current levels, respectively. Above these
levels, it only makes sense to talk about corrections within a bullish
trend. These indicators are still valid now. Sharp and high volumes
falling under these lines will be considered the beginning of the new
crypto winter.

Looking more locally, the latest consolidation in the crypto after a
downward momentum is hardly a good sign. We pay attention to the
cautious approach of bulls, which are not in a hurry to buy and waiting
for more precise signals for buying.

The graphical picture is quite problematic at the moment: [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is
drawing its fifth consecutive [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) decline candle, and each intraday
low is lower than the previous one.

On the data analysis side, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts keeps looping
around its 50-day moving average, which has been assuming the role of a
trend indicator for a few years now. A collapse and consolidation below
that line (today passes through $59.4K) risks triggering an even bigger
capitulation by buyers, who may rush to lock in profits after the rise
in October.

The picture for Ether is slightly more optimistic. By the end of the day
yesterday, ETHUSD had fumbled for support from buyers, holding it above
the $4000. This former resistance level now serves as solid support for
traders relying on tech analysis. However, a wider range of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
would probably prefer to see reliable signs of price gains and not rush
to buy near the critical line. Bulls and bears are now clearly aware
that opponents may be holding plans for a new attack near important
levels.
