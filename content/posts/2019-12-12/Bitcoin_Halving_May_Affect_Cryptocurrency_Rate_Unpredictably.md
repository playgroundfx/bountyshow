The world known cryptocurrency is almost 90 percent more expensive than
it was at least year ago and market participants hardly plan that this
is the limit of the price increase, as they have great plans for halving
event. The miners' reward for the mined block will be halved in five
months. Bitcoin had get through this process twice already, and its
price for the first time after the halving has increased almost 200
times, in the second - up to 7. No one guarantees such a result this
time.

The most important event in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of cryptocurrency, in particular
for Bitcoin network, the halving will take place in May 2020.
Traditionally, it makesÂ things hard for miners, since it will become
twice as difficult to make a profit from mining, because the reward will
be reduced by that much.

Recall, the first halving in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the main digital coin took
place in November 2012 - then for six months the asset rate increased by
120 percent - from $5 to $11, after which the cryptocurrency began to
increase much more sharply in price. In April 2013, the value of Bitcoin
reached $230, and by December - at $1,147, showing a record increase of
almost $20,000 over 1 1/2 years.

Now Bitcoin is in a situation that is not similar to what it was with
the first cryptocurrency in the past times before halving. Experts
believe that the value of Bitcoin will gradually increase after a
reduction in the reward for the mined block, but now no one can
guarantee a multiple increase in the price of an asset in a short period
of time.

As for the major cryptocurrencies rates on Thursday, they are as
follows:

  * Bitcoin lost 0.41 percent, to $7,172;

  * Ethereum gained 0.57 percent, to $143,49;
