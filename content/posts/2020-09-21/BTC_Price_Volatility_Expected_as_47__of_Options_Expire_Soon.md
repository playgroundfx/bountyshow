The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) is just 5% short of their
all-time high, but nearly half of this amount will be terminated in the
upcoming September expiry. Although the current $1.9 billion worth of
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) signal that the market is healthy, it’s still unusual to see
such heavy concentration on short-term [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

By itself, the current figures should not be deemed bullish nor bearish
but a decently sized [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) open interest and liquidity is needed to
allow larger players to participate in such markets. Notice how BTC open
interest has just crossed the $2 billion barrier. Coincidentally that’s
the same level that was achieved at the past two expiries. It is normal,
(actually, it’s expected) that this number will decrease after each
[calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) month settlement.

There is no magical level that must be sustained, but having [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
spread throughout the months enables more complex [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
More importantly, the existence of liquid futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) markets
helps to support spot (regular) volumes. To assess whether traders are
paying large premiums on BTC [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), implied volatility needs to be
analyzed. Any unexpected substantial price movement will cause the
indicator to increase sharply, regardless of whether it is a positive or
negative change.

The above chart clearly shows a massive spike in mid-March as BTC
dropped to its yearly lows at $3,637 to quickly regain the $5K level.
This unusual movement caused BTC volatility to reach its highest levels
in two years. This is the opposite of the last ten days, as BTC’s
3-month implied volatility ceded to 63% from 76%. Although not an
unusual level, the rationale behind such relatively low [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) premium
demands further analysis.

There’s been an unusually high correlation between BTC and U.S. tech
stocks over the past six months. Although it is impossible to pinpoint
the cause and effect, Bitcoin traders betting on a decoupling may have
lost their hope. The above chart depicts an 80% average correlation over
the past six months. Regardless of the rationale behind the correlation,
it partially explains the recent reduction in BTC volatility.

The longer it takes for a relevant decoupling to happen, the less
incentives traders have to bet on aggressive BTC price moves. An even
more crucial indicator of this is traders’ lack of conviction and this
might open the path for more substantial price swings. Most of the
relevant Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) mature on the last Friday of every month and
some concentration on the shortest ones is expected due to covered call
trades.
