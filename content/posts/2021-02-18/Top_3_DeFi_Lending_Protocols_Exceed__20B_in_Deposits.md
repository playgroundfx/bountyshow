There has been no slowdown in the amount of collateral pouring into the
leading decentralized finance protocols this year. DeFi’s leading three
lending protocols have amassed approximately $20 billion according to
Dune Analytics. A Messari research report into valuing these platforms
suggests they’re on track to generate in excess of half a billion in
interest annually.

Maker, Compound Finance, and Aave have all seen record levels of lending
deposits as crypto yield farmers seek exponentially better returns than
traditional banks can offer. Messari posted on Twitter: “The top three
lending platforms will generate $660m in interest per year at the time
of writing,”

Messari researcher Mira Christanto commented that protocols extract
value by both attracting capital and putting it to use, and their total
value locked (TVL) reflects this. TVL is the current metric for
measuring the performance of a DeFi protocol and it can vary depending
on the calculations employed by different analytics providers.

According to Dune Analytics, Maker has reached an all-time high of $6.38
billion in deposits locked as collateral. Compound Finance also has an
all-time high of $8.7 billion while Aave has $6.5 billion. Between them
they have a total of $21.58B. However, DappRadar and DeFi Pulse both
suggest the combined figure for the trio of protocols is currently more
like $17B.
