Bitcoin could rise to $1 million over the long term to become a reserve
currency for the world, according to one asset manager. But JPMorgan
warned of risks ahead as the cryptocurrency continues to rally. Anthony
Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, said
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could hit $500,000 by the end of the decade. It could eventually
reach $1 million per coin, he added, without giving a timeline.

> “I think that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will eventually rise to become the global
reserve currency. I think [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will eventually be much much larger
than the gold market cap,” he said during the latest episode of CNBC’s
“Beyond the Valley” podcast. Bitcoin has surged over the last few months
and surpassed $50,000 for the first time this week.

A number of factors are behind the rush into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). There has been
large participation from institutional and retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Major
companies are also getting more involved with the cryptocurrency. Square
bought some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) last year and Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla
purchased around $1.5 billion in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), according to a filing this
month. Musk and Square founder Jack Dorsey are both supporters of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Meanwhile, global central banks have been easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) — such
as lowering interest rates and buying assets through the so-called
quantitative easing program — to help cushion the blow to economies hit
by the coronavirus pandemic.

> “There were trillions of dollars that were printed and injected into
the economy and everyone from individuals to financial institutions and
corporations ran around the world looking for the best way to protect
their purchasing power, they ultimately decided it was [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),”
Pompliano said as he discussed what was behind [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s surge.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bull’s prediction that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could hit $1 million is based
on a few factors including the scarcity of the cryptocurrency which has
a cap of 21 million coins, as well as the decentralized nature of the
technology.
