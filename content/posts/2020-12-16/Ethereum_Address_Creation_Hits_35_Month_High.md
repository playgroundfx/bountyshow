Ethereum address creation hit a 35-month high on December 14 when
177,000 new addresses were added to the network according to analysts
from Santiment. The analytics provider reported that its network growth
metric showed Ethereum adding 177,500 addresses in a single-day on
Saturday, Dec. 12. The number of active addresses also surged on Dec. 14
to 714,081, though its all-time high came during the crypto boom in
January 2018 when it topped 1.1 million according to Bitinfocharts.com.

Spark?][1]

There could be a number of reasons for the uptick in address creation
and active addresses in recent months including the surge in DeFi
liquidity mining offering good returns with ETH as collateral. The
anticipation of staking rewards on the newly launched ETH 2.0 Beacon
Chain may have also driven address growth as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy ETH to stake
on the new [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). And of course Bitcoin prices are back near all
time highs, helping light a fire under other cryptocurrencies too.

But a Reddit thread about the milestone, discussed the possibility that
a token airdrop from Flare Networks for XRP holders was a big
contributor to the address creation spike. Flare is a new protocol that
intends to bring decentralized finance to the XRP ecosystem by making it
compatible with existing [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s with the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. Redditor SoundofCreekWater said: “Could be bc of the
XRP/Spark/Flare airdrop, which requires an [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/)-compatible address”.

Flare’s native FLR token will be used to collateralize the issuance of
FXRP, a fully trustless representation of XRP on the network. The
airdrop took a snapshot of XRP balances on Dec. 12, which coincided with
the Ethereum address creation spike. Flare explained that 45 billion
Spark tokens will be distributed, with 15% claimable at the time of
network launch which has been slated for three to six months’ time. The
rest will be distributed over the next two years.

While major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance are supporting the
airdrop and automating the process, those that hold their XRP off a
centralized exchange will have needed to create a Flare address in order
to be eligible for the airdrop. XRP prices have tanked 22% since the
snapshot took place.
