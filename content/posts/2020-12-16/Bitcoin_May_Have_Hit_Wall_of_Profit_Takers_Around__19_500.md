Bitcoin’s ascent above $19,500 was cut short early on Tuesday, possibly
due to profit taking by large Asia-based [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, according to one
analyst. The top cryptocurrency fell from $19,555 to $19,035, with most
of the drop unfolding during the two hours to 06:00 UTC, according to
CoinDesk 20 data. “I think Asian whales sold around $19,500 causing
prices to drop,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of South Korea-based [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk, referring to those with big
crypto holdings. He highlighted an increased inflow of coins onto crypto
exchange heavyweight Huobi Global, which has a Hong Kong presence, soon
before prices began falling.

> “A total of 2,013 coins were transferred to Huobi in blocks 661,425 to
661,430 just 15 minutes before the price dip,” Ju said, adding that
block number 661,425 carried 1,017 coins, the highest single-block
inflow on Huobi since Nov. 30. Monday saw 8,836 BTC arrive on Huobi in
total, with a mean transaction of 4.5 BTC, the highest since March 2018,
according to CryptoQuant. The uptick in the average size of exchange
deposits indicates that larger [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were transferring their coins
to Huobi and may have liquidated their holdings around $19,500, a level
which has acted as stiff resistance of late.

Bitcoin has failed multiple times to establish a foothold above that
point since Nov. 25, thought to be largely due to some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s booking
profits on fears of a near-term sell-off. At press time, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has
rebounded to near $19,300 and the path of least resistance for the
cryptocurrency remains to the higher side, according to analysts. The
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market sees a 35% probability of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) ending December above
$20,000, according to data source Skew. That’s significantly higher than
the single-digit probability seen three months ago when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was
trading near $10,000. Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s look to have bought call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) at
the $20,000 strike price on Monday.

Skew data shows the open interest or the number of open positions in the
bullish $20,000 call rose by 1,054 contracts on Deribit, the world’s
largest crypto [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) exchange by volume and open interest.

However, forcing a breakout above $20,000 in the short term may prove to
be an uphill task for the bulls, as there are sizable sell orders open
in the approach to a new record high spot price.
