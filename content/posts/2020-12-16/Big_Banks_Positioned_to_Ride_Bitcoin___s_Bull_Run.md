Traditional banks are now taking the plunge and coming out with crypto-
related services. The shift coincides with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price hitting all-
time highs in December.

![The Big Banks Positioned to Ride Bitcoin’s Bull Run][1]

Banks may have been looking closely at digital assets for some time now,
but have been skittish about saying anything in public. Now they appear
to be joining a general shift towards crypto in the latter half of 2020
that has included payments giant PayPal (PYPL) and hedge fund mavens
including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.

Starting with technologically advanced Switzerland and Singapore, where
some of the first big moves are happening, the industry is seeing a
growing list of lenders leaning towards crypto.

DBS Bank of Singapore recently announced its crypto trading and custody
platform (which is 10%-owned by the national stock exchange SGX) was
ready to go live, making it a frontrunner.

The same week DBS made its announcement, Swiss digital exchange SDX said
it was partnering with Japanese bank SBI Holdings, to build a digital
asset exchange in Singapore, although that won’t be ready until early
2022, the firms said.

An important milestone in October was Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the
Russian energy conglomerate, going live with crypto custody in
Switzerland. The bank used institution-focused custody tech from Swiss
firm METACO, which is working closely with core banking software vendor
Avaloq.

It later emerged Spanish bank BBVA will also be basing crypto operations
out of Switzerland, and using METACO’s custody tech. BBVA declined to
comment on the plans, which sources said would be ready in January 2021.

Another leading bank to emerge from the bushes is London-headquartered
Standard Chartered, which announced a crypto custody partnership with
U.S.-based Northern Trust.

CoinDesk also learned that Standard Chartered is working with five or
six of the largest trading desks and exchanges in crypto, including LMAX
and ErisX, for a post-trade and settlement system which is also slated
to go live early next year.
