Goldman Sachs isn’t convinced there’s a case for investing in
cryptocurrencies like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Crypto evangelists — perhaps
unsurprisingly — aren’t impressed with its assessment.

The U.S. bank’s consumer and investment management division released a
slide deck ahead of an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) call Wednesday, examining the impact of
the coronavirus outbreak on the U.S. economy. A sizable chunk of the
presentation focused on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other virtual currencies.

evangelists       ][1]

> “Cryptocurrencies including [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) are not an asset class,” Goldman
Sachs’ Investment Strategy Group wrote in the opening of one slide. The
deck detailed several reasons why cryptocurrencies couldn’t be
considered an asset class in their own right, claiming they don’t
generate cash flow likes bonds or earnings through exposure to global
economic growth.

> “We believe that a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent
on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a
suitable investment for our clients,” the group wrote.

“We also believe that while hedge funds may find trading
cryptocurrencies appealing because of their high volatility, that allure
does not constitute a viable investment rationale.”

Crypto enthusiasts had eagerly anticipated the Goldman call, with some
assuming the 151-year-old bank might lay out a case for investing in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Needless to say, they didn’t get what they wanted on Wednesday.

The Winklevoss twins, co-founders of the [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Gemini,
were among the most vocal in the backlash to Goldman’s claims.

> “Hey Goldman Sachs, 2014 just called and asked for their talking
points back,” Cameron Winklevoss said in a tweet.

His brother, Tyler, claimed, “The more I think about it, the Goldman
report is probably a head fake,” referring to a sports tactic used to
throw an opponent off by pretending you’re moving in one direction only
to then move the opposite way.

Bitcoin bulls often claim the digital asset’s limited supply is part of
what underpins its value and makes it a potential “hedge” against
currencies which are vulnerable to devaluation in times of economic
crisis.

The bank also called cryptocurrencies a “conduit for illicit activity,”
highlighting their use in [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent schemes and money laundering.

> “It’s important to note that Goldman Sachs’ competitors Fidelity and
JP Morgan have made significant investments in cryptocurrency,” said
Dave Hodgson, chief investment officer and managing director of NEM
Ventures, a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm. Fidelity last
year set up a separate unit devoted to cryptocurrency clearing and
custody, while J.P. Morgan developed its own internal digital currency,
“JPM Coin,” for payments.

> “While volatility is indeed high, the year-on-year, and now decade-
long performance is a consistent uptrend based on holding the asset, not
trading the volatility. By considering it unviable for its [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
Goldman Sachs has risked causing its [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to miss out on one of the
best performing asset classes in the past 100 years, never mind the last
10.”
