LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Bitcoin on Friday slumped as much as 5% to its
lowest since late September, tumbling under $41,000 amid a broader sell-
off for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin was last down 3.7% after touching $40,938, its lowest since
Sept. 29. The world's biggest cryptocurrency has lost over 40% since
hitting a record high of $69,000 in November and the volatility that has
plagued it since its birth 13 years ago remains stubbornly present.

The global computing power of the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network has dropped sharply
this week following the shutdown of Kazakhstan's internet as an uprising
hit the country's fast-growing cryptocurrency mining industry.

Bitcoin has also been under pressure after minutes from the latest U.S.
Federal Reserve meeting, released on Wednesday, appeared to lean toward
more aggressive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action, sapping [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) appetite for riskier
assets.

> "We are seeing broad risk-off sentiment across all markets currently
as inflationary concerns and rate hikes appear to be at the forefront of
speculators' minds," said Matthew Dibb, COO of Singapore crypto platform
Stack Funds.

>

> "Liquidity in BTC has been quite thin on both sides and there is risk
of a retreat back to the mid-30's on the short term."

Ether , the second largest token by market cap, fell as much as 8.6% to
$3,114, its lowest since Oct. 1.
