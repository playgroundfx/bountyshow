Shares of companies that have invested in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) have vastly
outperformed on Wall Street in 2021 and are extending their gains thanks
to Tesla’s $1.5 billion bet on the soaring digital currency. The price
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) hit a record high over $48,000 on Tuesday in a two-day surge
after Tesla said on Monday that it had bought the digital currency and
would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars.

A handful of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-related companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges

sheet. Tesla’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) purchase amounts to a minor bet for the fast-
