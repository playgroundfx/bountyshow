One metric suggests that heading into its fifth anniversary, Ethereum
has had a much faster rate of growth and adoption than Bitcoin. One key
metric suggests that Ethereum (ETH) has enjoyed a much faster rate of
adoption and growth in the first five years of existence than Bitcoin
(BTC).

![Ethereum’s Adoption Rate After 5 Years Far Exceeds Bitcoin’s][1]

Comparing the total number of addresses after n days for both Bitcoin
and Ethereum. Source: Cointelegraph, Glassnode, Etherscan. We compared
the total number of addresses created in the first five years on both
major [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) networks. While the number of addresses could be a good
gauge of the rate adoption, it may not be perfect for various reasons.
One reason is that the accounting systems in the two networks are
different.

versus Bitcoin. Source: Cointelegraph, Glassnode, Etherscan. In the
first 600 days, the growth rate for both networks is quite similar. By
mid-2017, however, Ethereum’s curve became much steeper. The most
obvious explanation is the ICO boom. The creation of thousands of ERC20
tokens and their subsequent distribution and trading led to a much
greater rate of Ethereum address creation.

Another advantage that Ethereum had from the beginning is that it was
standing on the shoulders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; whereas
Bitcoin was the world’s first decentralized electronic currency.
Bitcoin’s adoption was slow and gradual. The slope of its curve never
had an uplift similar to the ICO boom. In another five years, a similar
comparison will hopefully still remain relevant.
