HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Cryptocurrency-linked stocks dropped in
Hong Kong on Monday morning, after Chinese authorities intensified their
crackdown on the industry, while major cryptocurrencies steadied.

Shares of crypto asset manager and trading firm Huobi Tech, an affiliate
of Huobi Global, one of the world’s largest exchanges, fell more than
30% after the opening bell.

Huobi Global said on Sunday it had stopped taking new mainland customers
from Friday and would close accounts belonging to mainland-China based
clients by the end of the year to comply with local [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

China's regulators intensified a crackdown on Friday, banning
cryptocurrency transactions and mining, and saying that overseas
exchanges are barred from providing services to mainland [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s via
the internet and that mainland-China based employees of overseas crypto
exchanges would be investigated.

OKG Technology Holdings Ltd, a fintech and construction company majority
owned by Xu Mingxing the founder of cryptoexchange OK Coin, fell more
than 20%.

However, cryptocurrencies traded firmly on Monday, having rebounded from
selling driven by the Chinese crackdown as buy-the-dip speculators
swooped in.

Bitcoin was up about 2.4% in Asia trade at $44,250, having fallen to
just below $41,000 in the wake of Friday’s announcement of a blanket ban
on crypto mining and transactions in China - the most wide-ranging
clampdown yet.

Rival token ether rose 3% to $3,163 and has recouped its Friday losses.
