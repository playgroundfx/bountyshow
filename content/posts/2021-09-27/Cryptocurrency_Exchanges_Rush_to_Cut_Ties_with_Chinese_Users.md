SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchanges and providers of crypto
services are scrambling to sever business ties with mainland Chinese
clients, after Beijing last Friday issued a blanket ban on all crypto
trading and mining.

In a culmination of years of efforts to rein in the sector, 10 powerful
Chinese government bodies including the central bank, said overseas
exchanges were barred from providing services to mainland [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s via
the internet - a previously grey area - and vowed to jointly root out
“illegal” cryptocurrency activities.

Huobi Global and Binance, two of the world’s largest exchanges and
popular with Chinese users, have stopped new registrations of accounts
by mainland customers. Huobi also said it would clean up existing ones
by the end of the year.

> “On the very day we saw the notice, we started to take corrective
measures,” Du Jun, Huobi Group co-founder said in a statement to
Reuters.

Du did not give an estimate how many of its users would be affected,
saying only that Huobi, once the world’s biggest crypto exchange, had
embarked on a global expansion strategy many years ago and seen steady
growth in Southeast Asia and Europe.

Shares in crypto-related firms tumbled on Monday with crypto asset
manager and trading firm Huobi Tech plunging 23% and OKG Technology
Holdings Ltd, a fintech company majority owned by Xu Mingxing, the
founder of cryptoexchange OKcoin, losing 12%.

TokenPocket, a popular service provider of [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/)s, also said in
a notice to clients that it would terminate services to mainland Chinese
clients that risk violating Chinese policies and would “actively
embrace” [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/). It added it welcomes cooperation from China in
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technologies.

Many Chinese crypto exchanges shut down or moved offshore in 2017, after
China, once the world’s biggest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading and mining centre,
banned such platforms from converting legal tender into cryptocurrencies
and vice versa. Then in May this year, China’s State Council vowed to
ban [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading and mining.

Amid the crackdown, other types of Chinese crypto companies have been
moving out of China over the past few months, said Flex Yang, founder
and CEO of Babel Finance, adding that the impact from the latest [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
would be “limited”.

The Chinese crypto financial services provider this month opened new
business headquarters in Singapore.

Cobo, a crypto asset management and custodian platform, also recently
moved its headquarters from Beijing to Singapore.
