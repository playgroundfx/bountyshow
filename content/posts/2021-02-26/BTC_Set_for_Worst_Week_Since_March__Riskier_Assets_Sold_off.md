Bitcoin was headed on Friday for its worst week since March as a rout in
global bond markets sent yields flying and sparked a sell-off in riskier
assets.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency slipped as much as 6% to $44,451
before recovering most of its losses.

It was last trading down 1% at $46,671, on course for a drop of almost
20% this week, which would be its heaviest weekly loss since March last
year, when fears over the novel coronavirus caused havoc in financial
markets.

The sell-off echoed that in equity markets, where European stocks
tumbled as much as 1.5%, with concerns over lofty valuations also
hammering demand. Asian stocks fell by the most in nine months.

> “When flight to safety mode is on, it is the riskier investments that
get pulled first,” Denis Vinokourov of London-based cryptocurrency
exchange BeQuant wrote in a note.

Bitcoin has risen about 60% from the start of the year, hitting an all-
time high of $58,354 this month as mainstream companies such as Tesla
Inc and Mastercard Inc embraced cryptocurrencies.

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, which has seen huge inflows amid the
heightened interest in cryptocurrencies and manages almost $33 billion
in assets, was down 5.5% versus its previous close at $45.63.

The Purpose Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/), which became this month the world’s first
exchange traded fund physically settled by [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), last traded at $7.41
versus a net asset value of $9.36.

Its stunning gains in recent months have led to concerns from investment
banks over sky-high valuations and calls from governments and financial
regulators for tighter [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/).
