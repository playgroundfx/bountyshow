![Bitcoin miner revenue jumps by 50% in 4 days since record difficulty
drop][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) miner revenue jumped after the network saw its biggest-
ever difficulty drop, data shows. According to figures from monitoring
resource Blockchain.com, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) revenues have surged by over 50%. Bitcoin
mining is currently in a unique state of flux — around half of the
hashing power is offline as miners relocate from China, and it remains
unknown how quickly they will be able to come back online. At the same
time, those miners unaffected by the Chinese rout have seen half their
competitors disappear overnight, and profitability has gone up as a
result. With data now coming in for the past few weeks, the scale of the
changes is plain to see. Daily mining revenue was around $20.7 million
on Friday, the day before the difficulty adjustment. A day later, it hit
$29.3 million, and by Tuesday this week — $31.9 million.

This is all a consequence of a “very interesting dynamic,” analytics
firm Glassnode summarized in a video guide to this week’s edition of its
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter, “The Week On-chain.” “We have a very interesting dynamic
where approximately 50% of the hash power is currently offline and
incurring a great number of costs due to logistics and just simply not
hashing, having hardware that’s not currently working, and the other 50%
has essentially seen half their competition drop off the network,” it
explained. For active miners, profitability has reverted to around the
levels seen when BTC/USD traded at $55,000–$60,000.

Some are spending treasuries due to relocation costs while being unable
to mine new coins and receive a share of block rewards and fees. At the
same time, others have been holding on to more BTC per block than they
are spending — part of an uptrend that continues despite the drop in
price, which has also reached over 50%.
