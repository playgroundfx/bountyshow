There is a summer lull in the crypto market, which, however, may just be
the calm before the storm. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has lost 7%
and is trading around $32.3K. The price dynamic of the first
cryptocurrency with seriously reduced trading volumes is considered a
worrying sign. After all, if the market is affected by a small number of
open positions, then any small storm could turn into a large-scale sell-
off, disrupting an avalanche of stop orders.

The current levels near the local lows of the last two months make us
watch with bated breath for further movements. The decline of the first
cryptocurrency under $30k is likely to trigger a new wave of
liquidation. But the most alarming thing for crypto-enthusiasts is that
such an outcome will underscore the prolonged nature of the correction,
increasing speculation around a new “crypto winter” like in 2018.

Whether this is true or not, we will find out in the near future, but
for now, all major altcoins duplicate the price dynamics of the first
coin. The leading altcoin Ethereum is losing almost 6% in the last 24
hours, trading around $2,250, which is quite a comfortable level. The
project is consistently moving along the roadmap of the transition to
PoS. The developers have the confidence of market participants, and
Goldman Sachs recently called Ethereum more promising than Bitcoin.

If you try to summarise the number of projects and directions working on
this [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), there is an understanding that Ethereum may indeed, in
the long term, supersede BTC in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of usage, which will be the
foundation of the price. Stablecoins, De-Fi, and NFT tokens are running
on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). Since the beginning of 2021, $2.5 billion
worth of NFT tokens have been sold.

Visa’s data also looks encouraging, showing that more than $1 billion in
transactions have been made through cryptocurrencies since the beginning
of 2021. Various companies are increasingly offering cryptocurrency-
based products to customers. The ability to peg a cryptocurrency wallet
to one of the leading payment processors will significantly increase the
use of crypto products.

At this point, big capital may be watching the process of miners moving.
After the Chinese authorities banned miners, the hash rate in the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) fell by almost 50%, which led to significant changes in both
the difficulty of the algorithm and the profits of the remaining online
miners. At the moment, they are making income as if Bitcoin is worth
about $60K.

The miners’ likely choice of location for their work could affect the
market outlook. Moving to the U.S. could improve the image of the first
cryptocurrency, but there are suspicions that miners fear the U.S.
authorities as much as the Chinese. Kazakhstan, Mongolia and other
neighbouring countries with cold climates and access to cheap energy
could become new locations.

For now, according to Glassnode, the time of calculations of one block
has reached the highest value in Bitcoin [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). While this could cause
problems for the network in the event of high demand, the recalculation
of difficulty will correct for any changes in the hash rate. On the
other hand, we are now seeing a lucky combination in the market, with
some miners stopping mining new coins and spending their savings due to
the move, while others are mining significantly more than they are
spending.
