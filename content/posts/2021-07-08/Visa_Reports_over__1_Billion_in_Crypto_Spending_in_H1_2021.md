![Visa reports over $1 billion in crypto spending in H1 2021][1]

Global payments giant Visa will continue to support the development and
adoption of the cryptocurrency industry as part of its business, the
company said in its latest crypto update. In an official statement on
Wednesday, Visa announced that its crypto-enabled cards processed more
than $1 billion in total spending in the first half of 2021. The company
noted that Visa is partnering with 50 major companies in the crypto
industry as well as crypto card programs enabling users to convert and
spend digital currency at 70 million merchants worldwide. Given the size
of spending on Visa crypto-linked cards, the company said that “it’s
clear that the crypto community sees value in linking digital currencies
to Visa’s global network.”

Visa emphasized that its digital currency support does not require
global merchants to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) directly
though. As previously reported, Visa has been working with major crypto
players like [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) platform Crypto.com to enable a
crypto settlement system for fiat transactions. The company has also
been closely working with other major crypto companies like FTX
exchange, Coinbase, CoinZoom, and others.

The firm also stated that stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to the
value of other assets or fiat currencies like the United States dollar —
are “starting to live up the promise of digital fiat,” outlining its
developer-friendly features combined with the reliability of fiat-backed
reserves.
