This trend was highlighted in a recent post from analytics firm
Glassnode, in which they explain that over the past five years, the

roughly 63% to 49.9% currently.

revealed that the younger generations have a high inclination to invest

high chance that this trend will only pick up steam as demand for “hard
assets” continues growing.
