Banks must set aside enough capital to cover losses on any [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
holdings in full, global banking regulators proposed on Thursday, in a
“conservative” step that could prevent widescale use of the
cryptocurrency by major lenders.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, made up of regulators from
the world’s leading financial centres, proposed a twin approach to
capital requirements for cryptoassets held by banks in its first bespoke
rule for the nascent sector.

El Salvador has become the world’s first country to adopt [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as
legal tender even though central banks globally have repeatedly warned
that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the cryptocurrency must be ready to lose all their
money.

Major economies including China and the United States have signalled in
recent weeks a tougher approach, while developing plans to develop their
own central bank digital currencies.

The Swiss-based Basel committee said in a public consultation paper that
while bank exposures to cryptoassets are limited, their continued growth
could increase risks to global financial stability if capital
requirements are not introduced.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently worth around $1.6
trillion globally, which is still tiny compared with bank holdings of
loans, derivatives and other major assets.

Basel’s rules require banks to assign “risk weightings” to different
types of assets on their books, with these totted up to determine
overall capital requirements.

For cryptoassets, Basel is proposing two broad groups.

The first includes certain tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins
which would come under existing rules and treated in the same way as
bonds, loans, deposits, equities or commodities.

This means the weighting could range between 0% for a tokenised
sovereign bond to 1,250% or full value of asset covered by capital.

The value of stablecoins and other group 1 crypto-assets are tied to a
traditional asset, such as the dollar in the case of Facebook’s proposed
Diem stablecoin.

Nevertheless, given cryptoassets are based on new and rapidly evolving
technology like [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), this poses a potentially increased
likelihood of operational risks which need an “add-on” capital charge
for all types, Basel said.

‘UNIQUE RISKS’

The second group includes cryptocurrencies like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) that would be
subject to a new “conservative prudential treatment” with a risk-
weighting of 1,250% because of their “unique risks”.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not linked to any underlying
asset.

Under Basel rules, a 1,250% risk weight translates into banks having to
hold capital at least equal in value to their exposures to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) or
other group 2 cryptoassets.

> “The capital will be sufficient to absorb a full write-off of the
cryptoasset exposures without exposing depositors and other senior
creditors of the banks to a loss,” it added.

Few other assets that have such conservative treatment under Basel’s
existing rules, and include investments in funds or securitisations
where banks do not have sufficient information about their underlying
exposures.

The value of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has swung wildly, hitting a record high of around
$64,895 in mid-April, before slumping to around $36,834 on Thursday.

Banks’ appetite for cryptocurrencies varies, with HSBC saying it has no
plans for a cryptocurrency trading desk because the digital coins are
too volatile. Goldman Sachs restarted its crypto trading desk in March.

Basel said that given the rapidly evolving nature of cryptoassets, a
further public consultation on capital requirements is likely before
final rules are published.

Central bank digital currencies are not included in its proposals.
