Feb 8 (Reuters) - As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) drifts towards mainstream maturity in 2022,
daring crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are eyeing up new sources of explosive action:
"altcoins" that power online games and worlds.

But, be warned, the foothills of the unformed metaverse are no place for
the faint-hearted.

Bitcoin , which like the rest of the market had been largely sinking
since late 2021, has risen about 16% over the past two weeks to push
above $41,000, prompting many market players to declare an end to the
"crypto winter".

Yet newer and smaller coins linked to virtual platforms have enjoyed
stronger rallies amid the buzz around the metaverse.

Those used on gaming platform Axie Infinity and 3D virtual environment
Decentraland, for example - the Axie and Mana - have gained 35% and 57%
respectively in the same period since Jan. 24. The token of the Gala
gaming platform has jumped 125%, according to CoinMarketCap.

> "When people think of crypto they tend to think of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)," said Ed
Hindi, chief investment officer of Swiss-based cryptocurrency hedge fund
Tyr Capital. "But this ignores the fact that crypto is not a one-risk
asset class."

o give an idea of scale, though, the combined market cap of Axie, Gala
and Mana is about $12.7 billion, a fraction of the $800 billion-plus for
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which commands 40% of the market.

Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are looking to altcoins to diversify their holdings as 13
-year-old [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and No. 2 player ether increasingly move in step with
traditional stock markets and become more sensitive to macroeconomic
developments.

In a possible sign of this drive, multi-asset funds managing a
combination of coins saw inflows totalling $32 million in the week
ending on Jan. 28, the largest since June 2021, according to data from
CoinShares.

Yet the sheer novelty of many of these coins and the consequent lack of
track records significantly ups the danger stakes for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in an
already risky and nebulous crypto world. Furthermore the fortunes of the
likes of Axie and Gala are tied to the success of their gaming
platforms, as well as the wider virtual economy.

BOTTOM OF THE BLOCKCHAIN

Nonetheless, delving deeper into the virtual plumbing, some market
watchers say the growing interest in the metaverse is also benefiting
altcoins that are on the "Layer 1" protocol of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) - the base
level on which [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s between buyers and sellers are written in
code, and upon which virtual games and worlds are built.

They include ether of the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), and its challengers
Solana and Polkadot , which have risen 27%, 28% and 23% over the past
two weeks.

> "A lot of people are sensing this as a buying opportunity and what
they are purchasing is overwhelmingly high-quality blue chip alts over
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) right now," said Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer and co-
founder of crypto fund manager 21Shares based in New York and Zurich,
referring to coins on the Layer 1 [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), also including, Avalanche,
Polygon and Terra.

> "If you've developed a thesis around [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s, it's a wonderful
buying opportunity right now."

WHERE'S BITCOIN HEADING?

Back with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) - even though the dominant cryptocurrency is rallying
after nearly halving in value between early December and Jan. 24, its
upward trajectory is far from assured, according to indications from
hedging and other data.

Will Hamilton, head of trading and research at Trovio Capital
Management, cites futures funding rates, which have remained negative
since early December and suggest people are paying to be short. And he
also points to [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) data showing [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) to sell [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) versus
buying, the put/call ratio, has hit 58%, a level last seen in the May-
July 2021 selloff.

> "Throughout this period of consolidation, changes in the derivatives
market indicate traders continuing to bet on further downside," he said.
