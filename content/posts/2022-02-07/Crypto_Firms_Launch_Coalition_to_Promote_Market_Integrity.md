Feb 7 (Reuters) - A group of major cryptocurrency firms including
Coinbase, Circle, Anchorage Digital and Huobi Global are forming a new
coalition aimed at cracking down on market manipulation in an effort to
instill trust in the burgeoning digital asset industry.

The Crypto Market Integrity Coalition, which was convened by risk-
monitoring software company Solidus Labs, is also urging digital
currency companies to sign a “market integrity” pledge that acknowledges
the potential for [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) in the cryptocurrency space and the need for the
industry to protect [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

> “It really is about recognizing that you need entities that are
focused on a fair and orderly system here, and really trying to prevent
the abuses that can happen if you're not paying attention,” said Kathy
Kraninger, vice president of regulatory affairs at Solidus Labs and
former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The new alliance and pledge comes as regulators remain concerned the new
market is safe for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, despite its surge in popularity. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has cited the potential for market
manipulation as one of the primary reasons for rejecting several
applications for spot [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded funds.

Most recently, the markets regulator vetoed a proposal from Fidelity’s
Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust to offer an [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) that would track the
cryptocurrency, determining that it did not meet the standards designed
to prevent [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent and manipulative practices.

In December, the Bank for International Settlements called for more
regulatory safeguards to prevent crypto [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/), arguing that the limited
application of anti-money laundering rules, along with transaction
anonymity, exposes DeFi to illegal activities and market manipulation.

While this new pledge is a major acknowledgement of the potential for
[fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) within the crypto space, it remains unclear how exactly the
decentralized finance industry can curb bad actors.

The other founding members of the coalition are CrossTower, BitMex, GSR,
Bitstamp, Elwood, CryptoCompare, Securrency, MV Index Solutions, the
Chamber of Digital Commerce, Global Digital Finance and CryptoUK.

The coalition should help to “harmonize financial integrity standards”
across market participants as many await more regulatory clarity, said
Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at
Circle.

> “Integrity is paramount to the progress and ability of our industry to
continue innovating and building an infrastructure that delivers on the
promise of access to financial resources for all,” he said.

Although the group will initially be focused on recruiting additional
firms to sign its pledge, CMIC eventually hopes to be able engage with
regulators, promote training programs and endorse data-sharing
frameworks that can help to address concerns about transparency in the
cryptocurrency space.
