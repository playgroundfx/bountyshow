Bitcoin is up 9% over the past week, ending at around $41,700. Ethereum
is up 15%. Altcoins also woke up from hibernation and grew stronger than
the market: from 5.8% (Binance Coin) to 17.3% (Solana).

Over the same period, the total capitalization of the crypto market,
according to CoinGecko, grew by 11.2%, up to $1.99 trillion.

The primary growth of the crypto market last week came on Friday when
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at the end of the day soared by 10% in a few hours. The increase
was not prevented even by strong data on the US labour market, which
came out a couple of hours before the jump.

It is worth noting that the Nonfarm Payrolls can force the Fed to move
faster to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Against this background, the yield of
10-year Treasuries jumped above 1.93%, hitting new two-year highs, and
this could soon lead to sales in the stock market. If cryptocurrencies
manage to resist and continue to grow, this will be a serious trend
reversal order. Just like on Friday, when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s decided to buy BTC
in order to protect investments from inflation.

Since then, Bitcoin has already added 17%, moving into a phase of an
active uptrend. Technically, the first cryptocurrency broke the
resistance of the descending corridor. Accelerating growth and steady
buying throughout the weekend indicate a strong bullish momentum.
Cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now looking at the test of the 50-day moving
average. Previously, repeatedly fixing above this line preceded a multi-
month uptrend.

Potentially, this will also be lost now. Therefore, some players
consider this impulse as an important first signal of a recovery in
demand for risky assets, despite fears of a rate increase.

Meanwhile, billionaire Ray Dalio has warned that a number of governments
could outlaw cryptocurrencies. The government of the Russian Federation
is considering introducing a tax on miners of at least 15%. In the
meantime, the Fed has presented the Digital Dollar White Paper, but the
issue of its future launch has not yet been resolved.
