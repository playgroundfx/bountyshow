Bitcoin fell 5.4% on Thursday, ending the day near $39.6K, and further
to $38.9K on Friday morning, down 1% in 24 hours. Ethereum has remained
almost unchanged over the same time (-0.3%), while other leading
altcoins from the first are changing in different directions, from a
1.6% increase (XRP) to a 1% decrease (BNB).

According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market sank by 0.2% over the day to $1.74 trillion. The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
dominance index continues to decline, falling from 42.7% yesterday to
42.4% due to the greater stability of altcoins.

The crypto-currency index of fear and greed lost 6 points in a day to
22, again entering the territory of “extreme fear”.  
Bitcoin fully returned the growth of Wednesday, which was caused by the
adoption in the United States of the first document on the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of
cryptocurrencies. The decline in stock indices and the growth of the
dollar also did not favour the purchases of the first cryptocurrency,
which often moves in unison with the general demand for risks.  
The first decree on cryptocurrencies signed the day before can become
the basis for future US legislation on regulating relations in the
crypto sphere. Against this background, the shares of companies
associated with cryptocurrencies have noticeably risen in price.

One of the largest investment banks, Goldman Sachs, is going to expand
its offering for trading digital assets. The bank is exploring the
possibility of launching bilateral crypto-currency [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

World-famous [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) and writer Robert Kiyosaki has warned that the
world economy is now on the verge of hyperinflation and advised to “stay
away” from the stock market.

Against the backdrop of a severe crisis in the financial system of the
Russian Federation and restrictions imposed on the circulation of the
dollar and the euro, the demand of the population for cryptocurrency has
increased sharply. Now it is primarily used for the transfer of capital
abroad or for parking in “hard” currency.

Analysts believe that regulators are unlikely to be able to effectively
prevent such transactions. But the state is helped by crypto-exchanges,
which block the Russians on their own initiative.

There remain the possibilities of p2p platforms, that is, transfers
between individuals. However, there are significant risks of [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)
associated with such transactions.
