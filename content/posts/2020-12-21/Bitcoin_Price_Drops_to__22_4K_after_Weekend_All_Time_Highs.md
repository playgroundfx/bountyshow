Bitcoin (BTC) lost $23,000 support on Dec. 21 as Monday trading saw a
long-awaited correction begin to take shape. The move comes as U.S.
futures also dropped in pre-market hours by roughly 2.5% on concerns
over the new coronavirus strain in the U.K.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting
lows of $22,410 at press time, with 24-hour losses totaling around 3.3%.

The move confirms suspicions among analysts that Bitcoin is due for a
retracement after a week of near-constant gains. Traders are now eyeing
$20,000, which orderbook data paints as a potentially formidable support
level.

At the start of last week, the largest cryptocurrency was still at under
$19,500, a level which Cointelegraph Markets analyst MichaÃ«l van de
Poppe believes could now form a short-term price target.

$22,800, he added in comments over the weekend, forms a crucial area to
hold in order to preserve the prospects of further upside.
