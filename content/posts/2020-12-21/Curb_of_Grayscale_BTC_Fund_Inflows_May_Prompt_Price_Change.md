Such a drop in flows into the largest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -3.75%) fund would

Bloomberg Monday.

The digital asset manager’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) inflows “are too big to allow any
position unwinding by momentum traders to create sustained negative
price dynamics,” the strategists said.

They stopped short of saying [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is overbought after the
cryptocurrency has soared to consecutive record highs in recent weeks.

The most recent data tweeted by Grayscale Investments showed the firm
reached $15.5 billion in cryptocurrency assets under management on Dec.
18 – up $2 billion in less than a month. Its Bitcoin Trust is now worth
over $13 billion of that total.

Bitcoin hit a new record price of $24,273 on Sunday. At the time of
publication, prices were lower around $23,450.
