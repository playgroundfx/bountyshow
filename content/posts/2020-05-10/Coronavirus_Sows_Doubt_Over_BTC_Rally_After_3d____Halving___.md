As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s brace for a long-awaited technical adjustment that
will halve new supply of the cryptocurrency, the coronavirus pandemic
has cast uncertainty over the expected rally that has [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly
accompanied such events.

![Coronavirus Sows Doubt Over BTC Rally After 3d ‘Halving’][1]

This “halving,” the third in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s 11-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), has been widely
flagged. The previous events fueled huge surges in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s market
value, but there is a wildcard this time in the form of the coronavirus
pandemic, some analysts said.

Bitcoin relies on “mining” computers that validate blocks of
transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10
minutes. In return, the first miner to solve the puzzle and clear the
transaction is rewarded new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s. The technology was designed in
such a way that it cuts the reward for miners by half after every
210,000 blocks mined or roughly every four years, a move meant to keep a
lid on inflation. That reduction in the rate at which new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) enters
the system should theoretically push the price up.

The halving could happen as soon as Monday or Tuesday, with most Bitcoin
platforms showing that only about 100 blocks needed to be mined before
hitting the halving threshold. The mining reward is currently 12.5
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s per block mined. In this week’s halving, the reward will fall
to 6.25 new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s.

In the run-up to this week’s halving, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) had surged nearly 40%
since the beginning of the year and climbed more than 85% from its lows.
By comparison, the dollar index USD is up 3.3% so far this year. The
first halving occurred in November 2012 when the mining reward was
reduced from 50 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s to 25, and the second occurred in July 2016
when it was further cut to 12.5 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). This deflationary event has
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly signaled the start of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s most dramatic bull runs
over a period of several years, although not before a brief sell-off.

The previous two [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) halvings propelled rallies of about 10,000%
from late 2012 to 2014, and roughly 2,500% from mid-2016 to the
currency’s all-time high just shy of $20,000 in December 2017, according
to traders. There are only 21 million [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s in existence and more
than 18 million are already in circulation.
