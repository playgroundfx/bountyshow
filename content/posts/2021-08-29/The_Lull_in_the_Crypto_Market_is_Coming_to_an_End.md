Bitcoin has been hanging around recently reached levels for the last
week and a half, fully reflecting the final phase of the summer lull.

However, with the beginning of autumn, the end of vacations, and
possibly harsh decisions by the Fed regarding its stimulus [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), we
may see the most unexpected turns in price dynamics.

If the Fed starts to normalize its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market will face
significant stress. What happens if [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s realize at one point that
the era of cheap money is inevitably ending? A sell-off will begin, and
in this case, cryptocurrencies act as a kind of asset that is “not of
prime necessity and importance” for big capital.

Bitcoin will likely start to sell off because big [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are hardly
crypto-enthusiasts. What can give Bitcoin a powerful growth momentum?
The coin needs to become a mass payment tool, which is very unlikely
given the complexity of the process for the average user and the extreme
volatility.

On the other hand, this keeps US authorities from acting decisively and
quickly to curb the development of cryptocurrencies. We all remember how
quickly Facebook and Telegram coins were crushed when the prospect of
launching massive and cheap substitutes for the US dollar appeared.

Thus, we are now witnessing a precise but delicate balance. Bitcoin is
the equivalent of a digital casino, a direction for diversifying
investments, a means of payment for geeks, a digital payment testbed for
troubled and weak economies, and a kind of offshore for governments that
cannot officially interact with each other. And it all works thanks to
relatively low volumes relative to the traditional market.

Autumn and winter are traditionally the “hottest” seasons for the global
market. With pandemics and lockdowns, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have had the
opportunity to go on vacation for the first time. This may explain the
relative lull in the crypto market.

The effects of the coronavirus are just beginning to hit the global
economy, and without a steady supply of liquidity, the bubbles inflated
by cheap money could start to burst. From now on, you better fasten your
seat belts and be ready for the turbulence that will affect all assets
without exception.
