While the cryptocurrency has declined from $12,400 to $10,000 in the
past three weeks, the number of “accumulation addresses” has increased
by 2% to 513,000, according to data source Glassnode. “Lots of new [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
buyers are coming in to absorb supply,” Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based
Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming non-
dust transfers (representing minuscule amounts of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)) and have
never spent funds. The metric excludes addresses belonging to miners and
exchanges, and addresses active more than seven years ago to exclude
lost coins.

The divergence between prices and accumulation addresses suggests that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s view the recent price drop as a typical bull market pullback
and expect prices to rise once more. “Markets typically retrace one
third or more in a bull market after local euphoria,” Zhu tweeted on
Friday, suggesting prices could drop to as low as $8,800 and still be a
“healthy target.”
