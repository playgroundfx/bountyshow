CryptoCompare said crypto derivative volumes rose 54% to more than $710
billion in August in its monthly Exchange Review. That’s a new all-time
high, with August’s figures now far exceeding the $602 billion monthly
volumes reported in May.Spot markets also experienced a surge in
activity, with August trading volumes coming to $820 billion – nearly
$400 billion up from July’s numbers.

Constantine Tsavliris, CryptoCompare’s head of research, told CoinDesk
that the surge in crypto derivative volumes was likely a result of last
month’s rally, which brought [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) from $9,200 to near $12,400 at its
peak. Spot price movement and volatility were higher in August than
July, said Tsavliris. As a rule, this generally leads to greater trading
activity for cryptocurrencies and their derivatives.

Derivative volumes soared to then-record highs in May due to speculation
surrounding the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) halving event.
