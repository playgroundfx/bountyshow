During a 30% price drop at the beginning of September, at least 68
Ethereum whales joined the network, potentially adding millions in
holdings. According to Crypto Twitter user Ali Martinez, data from
analytics site Santiment shows the number of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s holding between
1,000-10,000 Ether (ETH) — roughly $350,000-3.5 million as of this
writing — increased by 68 in the three days since Aug. 31. The drop
comes while the token fell 30.2% from $367 on Aug. 31 to a monthly low
of $326 on Sept. 5.

The growing DeFi market fueled demand for ETH starting in June, as did
the rising gas costs — reaching a high of roughly 485 Gwei on Sept. 1 —
with an increasing number of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) transactions. However, the average
gas fee is now just 98 Gwei following the price drop coupled with
projects like SUSHI plunging 88% in just 5 days.
