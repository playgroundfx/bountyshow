Singaporeâ€™s new financial legislation is aimed to boost crypto-related
activities in the country. This legislation, the Payment Service Act
which enters into force on Tuesday, is the first one of this kind in the

which use the crypto trading and digital payments of tokens such as
Ethereum and Bitcoin.

So, Singapore-based businesses, that involve digital payments and
cryptocurrency trading, are required now to first register and only then
to apply for a license in order to legally operate.

In addition to the fact that cryptocurrencies fall into the regulatory
framework, the PSA (Payment Services Act 2019) will transfer to the
Monetary Authority of Singapore formal power to AML (anti-money
laundering) official power to supervise cybersecurity risks and control
money laundering and terrorist financing using cryptocurrencies.
Moreover, according to the official announcement, the law will help
"strengthen consumer protection and build confidence."

By the way, Tokyo [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Liquid Group was among a
number of companies who welcomed the initiative, being ready to apply
already for its Singaporean license. London-based Luno announced the
same plans.

Recall, the law was adopted in January 2019, but entered into force only
a year later. He will regulate a wide range of companies in the area of
digital payments, including "new types of payment services, such as
services based on digital payment tokens." Thus, to ensure compliance
with its requirements should all [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s and other
companies with similar business models.

It seems that Singapore intends to narrow the gap that has formed with
Japan and Malta, which have already become the largest hubs for
cryptocurrency companies.

All crypto companies in the country have one month to register. Another
six months will be allocated to apply for a payment institution license.
After that, such companies will have to comply with all applicable
requirements in the context of combating money laundering and terrorist
financing. The Monetary Authority of Singapore pays special attention to
this problem due to the possibility of cross-border anonymous
transactions using cryptocurrencies.

As for the major cryptocurrency rates, they are as follows on Tuesday,
at 1346 GMT:

  * Bitcoin gained 1.20 percent, to reach $9,061;

  * Bitcoin Cash eased by 0.73 percent, to $368,30;

  * Ethereum grew by 0.45 percent, to $171,88;

  * Ripple jumped by 2.55 percent, to $0,2386;

  * Litecoin rose by 1.07 percent, to $59,57.
