Contrary to the fact that during the past year, Bitcoin lost about 75
percent of its value, market participants are watching as a digital
currency, which is supported except by the faith of people in it, began
to gain momentum again. Thus, since the beginning of April 2019, Bitcoin
has grown by  more than 250 percent, reaching its maximum level, last
seen in March, 2018.

There are no signs so far that Bitcoin intends to stop its confident
ascent, reaching the mark just above $11,000 on Friday, and inching even
higher on Monday, marking thus its 15-month peak

The most famous cryptocurrency continues to grow, the highest mark on
Tuesday was noted at 7.15 GMT at the level of $11,401, but the day is
only heating up.

Trading with a higher tick on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on the Binance exchange was not
good for everyone. No sooner was launched a margin trading on the
Binance’s platform than the first scalping was detected. The owner of
short positions on Bitcoins was “liquidated” on Monday, according to
Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao comments.

The main cryptocurrencies showed the following rates on Tuesday, at 7.48
GMT:

  * Bitcoin added 4.20 percent, to $ 11,335;

  * Bitcoin Cash rose 2.07 percent, to $ 477.40;

  * Ethereum increased its value by 2.30 percent, to $ 312.95;

  * Ripple went up by 1.99 percent, to $ 0.4689;

  * Litecoin went up by 1.61 percent, to $ 134.84.
