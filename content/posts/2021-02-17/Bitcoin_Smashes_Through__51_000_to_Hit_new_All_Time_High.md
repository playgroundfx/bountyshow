Bitcoin surged above the $51,000 level on Wednesday for the first time.

The red-hot cryptocurrency hit a fresh record price of $51,715 at around
4:50 a.m. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics. It was later trading
5% higher at $51,024.

Bitcoin was created in 2009, not long after the global financial crisis.
It has gone from a protest against the banking system to something of a
“digital gold” that is beginning to catch on with mainstream [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

On Wall Street, major investment banks appear to be warming to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
JPMorgan said recently it’s looking seriously at the asset class, and
Goldman Sachs has also shown an interest in crypto. A division of Morgan
Stanley is reportedly considering adding [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to its list of possible
bets.

Companies like PayPal and Mastercard have made significant moves to
support cryptocurrencies. And Tesla last week said it had invested $1.5
billion into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and planned to accept the digital currency as
payment for its products.

> “We believe the story and theme here is much larger than just
investing in Bitcoin and predicting its future price, but rather around
the potential ramifications that crypto, [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could
have across the technology and corporate world for the next decade,” Dan
Ives, Wedbush Securities’ managing director, said in a note Wednesday.

“From Paypal, and Square, to the likes of Nvidia, Tesla, IBM, Visa,
Mastercard and many other companies across verticals, we believe the
trend of transactions, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) investments, and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) driven
initiatives could surge over the coming years as this [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mania is
not a fad in our opinion, but rather the start of a new age on the
digital currency front.”

Bitcoin’s latest rally has reminded many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of its massive ascent
to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by a plunge the following
year that saw the digital coin lose 80% of its value.

But the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has since staged a fierce
comeback, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% this year.

Bitcoin’s proponents say it’s due to increased demand from institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as well as corporate buying of the digital currency from the
likes of Tesla, Square and MicroStrategy. Skeptics, on the other hand,
worry [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may be the biggest market bubble in financial markets.

Strategists at JPMorgan warned in a note Tuesday that unless [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s
volatility starts to ebb, its current price “looks unsustainable.”
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation for their
extreme price swings.
