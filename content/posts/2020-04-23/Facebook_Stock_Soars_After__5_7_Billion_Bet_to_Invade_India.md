Facebook’s stock is soaring after a surprise investment in Reliance Jio,
India’s largest telecom. The move will give the social media giant a
foothold in India’s large market. And the two companies may be teaming
up to develop a “super app” to rival China’s WeChat.

This comes at a time when American companies are looking to decouple
from China due to rampant intellectual property theft and unfair trade
practices. India, with its rapid GDP growth and large population, could
offer an alternative market without all the headaches associated with
investing in China.

Throughout its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), Facebook has delivered some of the best top-line
growth in the market. In 2019, the company generated sales of $70.7
billion, a 26.6% jump from the prior-year figure. This revenue growth is
powered by an eye-watering Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of $41.41 in
the United States and Canada.

Facebook’s ARPU in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes India, is a
more modest $3.57. Clearly, the region is a massive growth opportunity
for the company. Right now, Facebook’s biggest footprint in the Indian
market comes from its WhatsApp user base. The app is used by 400 million
Indians — more than any other country in the world. And according to
India’s Economic Times, Facebook and Reliance Jio plan to work together
to create a multi-purpose “super-app” that will combine social media
with shopping, travel bookings, and payment processing. This will be a
direct competitor with Tencent’s WeChat, a Chinese app with a similar
business model.

Facebook has been trying to crack the Indian telecom industry for
several years now. The company tried unsuccessfully to launch a free-
but-restricted internet service called Free Basics. But it was banned by
Indian’s telecom regulator for allegedly infringing on net neutrality.

Now, the American social media giant is trying a different tactic by
investing directly in Reliance Jio, an already established player in the
market. With over 388 million customers, Jio is a force to be reckoned
with. And Facebook’s $5.7 billion investment gives it a 9.99% stake in
the company.

Facebook’s India investment may be part of a larger trend of American
tech companies pivoting away from China because of blatant intellectual
property theft and corporate favoritism by the Chinese state. American
corporations frequently find themselves forced out of the Chinese market
only to compete with state-sponsored rivals with suspiciously similar
business models. A good example of this phenomenon is search engine
Baidu, which took Google’s spot in China after the latter was forced out
of the country due to its unwillingness to follow censorship
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

Will India Accept Facebook’s Move?  
While India doesn’t share China’s track record of corporate favoritism
and extreme protectionism, it isn’t necessarily a utopia for foreign
businesses. And the recent drop in Indian equity prices due to the
coronavirus has some regulators worried that international conglomerates
might swoop in and take advantage of the situation.

Last week, India amended its foreign direct investment [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to require
all bordering countries to seek government approval for all investment
deals. This legislation is designed to quote “curb the opportunistic
takeover” of Indian firms dealing with the pandemic.

Based in the United States, Facebook would be exempt from the rule. But,
due to the scale of the investment, the deal must be approved by India’s
anti-trust regulator, the Competition Commission of India. According to
the Times of India, the massive amount of user data the companies will
jointly hold could be a cause for concern.

Facebook’s stock rallied 6.72% to close at $182.28 on Wednesday.
Reliance Jio currently trades at around 1,363 Indian rupees.
