On August 28, Binance Futures launched its DeFi Composite Index, a
basket of DeFi tokens that initially comprised 27% Chainlink (LINK) and
11% Aave (LEND) alongside nine other prominent DeFi tokens that made up
between 6% and 9.5% of the index each. Updated weekly, the index now
tracks 19 different crypto assets.

However the Binance Futures’ DeFi index has dropped more than 50% from
an all-time high of $1,189 on its first day of trading, with the basket
now changing hands for just $507. Indexes tracking decentralized finance
(DeFi) tokens have taken a beating over recent weeks following the
popping of August’s DeFi bubble.

On September 15, TokenSets launched its ‘DeFi Pulse Index Set’ (DPI) —
which is composed of tokens from the ten-largest decentralized finance
protocols by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Pulse. The
basket is rebalanced on the first day of every month, with each token’s
sizing adjusted according to “its relative circulating market cap to
other positions in the index.”

Despite the TVL of the DeFi sector continuing to push higher, the DPI
has shed nearly one-third of its value since launching — dropping from
$130 in mid-September to test support at $90. Other crypto market data
[aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)s are signaling that DeFi is down, with only 16 of the 100
tokens categorized as ‘DeFi’ on CoinMarketCap posting gains of more than
1% over the past seven days.

Despite the heavy price retracements produced by most DeFi tokens, the
sector’s fundamentals continue to strengthen. DeFi’s TVL has increased
by nearly 40% from $7.4 billion over the past 30 days, while
decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap generated more than $15 billion in
volume last month — more than top U.S.-based centralized crypto asset
exchange, Coinbase.
