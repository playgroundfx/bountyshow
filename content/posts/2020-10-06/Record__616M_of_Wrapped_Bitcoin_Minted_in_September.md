Wrapped Bitcoin minted a record $616 million worth of tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s
in September, according to transaction data analyzed by CoinDesk, a more
than 160% increase over the $232 million minted in August. Record
minting comes as strong over-the-counter demand for wrapped [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
continues, according to Chicago-based firm Grapefruit Trading, one of
the first OTC desks to mint WBTC through BitGo.

Getty Hill, trader at Grapefruit, told CoinDesk their clients’ interest
in converting BTC to WBTC reflects market participants capitalizing on
the growing number of opportunities for using pseudo-BTC in the growing
decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. At FTX, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried
told CoinDesk OTC demand for WBTC is also significant, even if it’s not
at the same level as during the height of the DeFi craze over the past
few months.

Even if it cools off a bit in the coming months, he expects client
demand for tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to “sustain itself at a way higher level
than before.” Alameda Research has been the leading wrapped [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
merchant for the past two months due to over-the-counter demand at its
sister company, FTX. In August, Alameda minted $160 million worth of
WBTC followed by $306 million minted in September.

September’s growth also benefited from the activity of some large
merchants who minted no WBTC the month before. Beyond WBTC, the supply
of all forms of tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s grew 120% in September, according to
data from Dune Analytics, to over 121,000 BTC, up from nearly 55,000 BTC
in August, as growth among smaller BTC tokenization projects continues.
