According to data from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the
Ethereum hash rate hit an all time high of more than 250 terahashes per
second (TH/s) on Oct. 6, marking an 80% rise since January. Glassnode
reported that a surge in the hype surrounding DeFi projects this year
sparking higher gas fees may have contributed to the metric reaching an
all time high.

In addition, data from crypto mining pool F2Pool shows that it is
currently up to three times as profitable to mine Ethereum (ETH) instead
of Bitcoin (BTC). F2Pool, which calculates mining profitability by
determining current revenue (block reward and transaction fees) and
deducting the cost of power, reports that BTC Antminer S19 Pro miners
can earn $4.33 in profits over 24 hours, while ETH miners using GTX
TitanV 8 cards can expect $15.56 over the same period â€” making it 259%
more profitable at present. Six of the mining rigs monitored by F2Pool
show Ethereum miners show a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) profit of more than $10, while only
two Bitcoin mining rigs have profits of more than $4.

Hash rate is a key metric when determining the health and security of a
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). It measures the computing power of the network. The last
time the Ethereum hash rate was near these all time high levels was in
August 2018, when the metric reached 246 TH/s. However, the price of the
token steadily decreased from more than $400 to under $100 by December
that year.

Data from Glassnode shows Ethereum miners made $166 million from
transaction fees alone in September. In contrast, Bitcoin miners earned
only $26 million from fees over the same period.

However, earnings from transaction fees have dropped significantly more
recently. Cointelegraph reported that average gas fees have dwindled
since peaking at $11.60 on Sept. 17th to $2.98 on Oct. 1, a decline of
more than 74% in two weeks.
