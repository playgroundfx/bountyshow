For the third day in a row, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is hovering around $56.7K with a
slight downward bias. The pressure from traditional financial markets is
already hard to speak of as there has been some rebound.

This time around, the stability of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dynamics is not a balance
between a furious tug-of-war and a tight spring. Instead, we see neat
selling on growth attempts, with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) sellers turning the price
around each time from ever-lower levels.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index lost another point, dropping to
31. However, its reading seems somewhat outdated, as the top coins have
been trending in green so far today. Over the past 24 hours, the total
capitalisation of the crypto market has risen by 0.85% to 2.62.

During the week, a whole cycle of market sentiment shifted with a sharp
dip, followed by recovery and a local renewal of highs. Still, already
on Thursday, it was noticeable how enthusiastic buying was met with
selling pressure.

It seems that retail and short-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in cryptocurrencies are
keen to capitalise on a very successful year. That said, it is hardly
fair to speak of any fundamental break in the bullish trend.

The market’s optimism is also supported by ETHUSD. It picked up on
Thursday on a drawdown below 4500. We have yet to find out whether this
was a sign of the end of a mini-correction.

This Friday promises to be very turbulent for the financial markets,
which are near key levels ahead of the publication of the labour market
data. It used to be the most unpredictable and meaningful market [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
although now the Fed’s interpretation of the published data sets the
tone.
