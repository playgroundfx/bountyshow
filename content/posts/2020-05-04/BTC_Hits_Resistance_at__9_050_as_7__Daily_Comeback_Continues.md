Bitcoin (BTC) was back on May 1 as the largest cryptocurrency regained
$9,000 after climbing 7% in less than 24 hours. Data from Cointelegraph
Markets and CoinMarketCap showed a triumphant return to form for
BTC/USD, which a day previously had fallen as low as $8,400.

After what appeared to be a mass profit-taking exercise during its trip
to $9,450 this week, Bitcoin once again surged higher after tanking
$1,000. At press time, $9,000 was still in the process of settling, with
its status as support over resistance still uncertain. Nonetheless, 7.2%
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) gains formed yet another sign of Bitcoin’s strength, following an
unprecedented period of recovery of 160% versus March lows of $3,600.

> “I’m truly, truly impressed,” Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de
Poppe tweeted about Friday’s performance. Van de Poppe had previously
said that he saw resistance kicking in at a maximum of $9,400, with a
support floor at $8,200 in the event of a market drop. “First
significant resistance hit,” he added as $9,000 briefly reappeared.
Range still structured after that bounce from $8,400. Break above
$9,000-9,050 and I’m aiming for $9,300-9,400 again for potential shorts.

Cointelegraph has closely tracked Bitcoin’s price behavior this week and
will continue to do so as the long-awaited block reward halving nears
and fiat markets remain highly unstable.
