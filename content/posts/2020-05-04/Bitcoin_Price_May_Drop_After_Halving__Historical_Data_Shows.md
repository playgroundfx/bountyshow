The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 130% since
bottoming out at $3,867 on March 13 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin
Price Index. The cryptocurrency jumped from $6,700 to $9,400 in the last
10 days of April alone. What’s more, prices gained over 15% last week to
register [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s first seven-week winning streak in 12 months.

Notably, the big gains have happened in the weeks leading up to the
mining reward halving, due on May 12, and are reminiscent of similar
price rallies seen ahead of the previous two halvings, which took place
in 2016 and 2012.

The term “halving” refers to a programmed-in event in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s code,
which reduces the reward per block mined by 50% every four years to
control inflation. Following the upcoming halving, rewards issued will
drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC.

Bitcoin appreciated by 34% from $9.5 to $12.75 in the four weeks to Nov.
28, 2012, when mining rewards were trimmed by 50% for the first time.
The cryptocurrency underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016. On that
day, it was trading near $660, representing over 45% gain on the low of
$440 observed in mid-May (though it peaked at $780 in mid-June).

Bitcoin also witnessed unprecedented gains in 12 to 15 months following
previous halvings. For instance, the cryptocurrency rose to a record
high of $20,000 in December 2017.

Some observers expect [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to chart a similar uptrend following the
May 2020 supply cut. Investors, however, should note that the previous
bull runs did not start immediately after halvings. In fact, the 2016
halving was followed by a notable price drop.

Bitcoin traded in a sideways manner for over two weeks following its
second halving and fell to $465 on Aug. 2 – a loss of nearly 30% from
the halving day price of $660.

The fresh record high above $1,160 was set nearly eight months after the
supply cut. The upward momentum gathered pace in the following months
and prices reached $20,000 in December 2017.

Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would argue that the cryptocurrency remained bid
following its first halving on Nov. 28, 2012. However, back then, the
community was quite small and primarily consisted of “believers,” who
cheered the first supply cut.

That said, prices rose only 6% from $12.75 to $13.50 in the two weeks
after halving and remained sidelined in the following five weeks.

Some miners may take advantage of the recent price rise by liquidating
their crypto earnings over the next 12 days. “That will allow them to
keep accumulating [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) post-halving,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and
founder of the [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Coinswitch.co.

The May 2020 halving is different from the previous two events, as it is
happening against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis.

> “This Bitcoin halving will certainly be different to the last, as
Satoshi Nakamoto’s economic system will have the opportunity to prove
its resilience and strength in comparison with traditional Wall Street
protocols,” said Andy Ji, co-founder of Ontology, the public [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
and distributed collaboration program.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global economy and forced
governments and central banks across the globe to add trillions of
dollars of stimulus to the financial system.

The global economy was in relatively better shape when the
cryptocurrency experienced its second supply cut in July 2016. Notably,
China’s producer price index or factory-gate prices bottomed out in the
first quarter of 2016 and turned positive in September of that year,
triggering a reflationary bull market in commodities and equities.

Put simply, people currently have a strong reason to search for
alternatives like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which are getting scarcer with every halving.
As a result, notable price dips, if any, could be short-lived and the
odds of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) setting new highs next year look strong.

Open interest or open positions in futures listed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, which is considered synonymous with the
institutional activity, rose to $339 million on Friday – the highest
level since July 10, 2019, according to data provided by the crypto
derivatives research firm Skew. The metric has risen sharply from the
low of $107 million observed on March 12.
