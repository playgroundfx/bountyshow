On Tuesday, Bitcoin showed a growing momentum at the beginning of the
day and reached five-week highs above $45,000. After a short-term rise
above this level, a corrective decline began in the middle of the day.
The benchmark cryptocurrency was losing more than $2,000 despite the
rise in stock indices. There was a sharp rebound towards the end of the
day and closed the day almost unchanged as a result.

Recovery in institutional demand for stocks late in the day on Tuesday
helped Bitcoin stay above the 50-day moving average as well. Continued
buying on the decline to this level will keep the technical picture
bullish as upside momentum develops to $49-50K.

A sharp dip lower today or tomorrow will raise the issue of a false
break and bring the sellers back into play, heading for $37-38K.

It became known that at the end of last week, the Canadian exchange fund
Purpose Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) bought 1.75 thousand BTC in two days, which could
lead to a sharp increase in prices. In addition, Valkyrie Investments
has received approval from the SEC to launch an exchange-traded fund
([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)) based on the shares of companies that receive at least 50% of
their profits through mining.

At the same time, the US authorities confiscated [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s stolen from
the Bitfinex crypto exchange in 2016 for $3.6 billion and detained those
involved in the hack. The Russian Federation government approved the
concept of the Ministry of Finance for the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of
cryptocurrencies: a joint bill should be ready by February 18.

Overall, Bitcoin gained 0.3% on Tuesday, ending the day around $44,200.
Ethereum was down 1.3%, while the other leading altcoins in the top ten
were mixed from a 5.7% decline (Binance Coin) to an increase of 5.4%
(XRP).
