It is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, will become
the world’s richest person if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hits
approximately $182,000. As of March 2021, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is
the richest person on earth with a net worth of $181.6 billion. Elon
Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is a close second at $163.7 billion, owning more
than 20% of the electric car maker. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of
Bitcoin, released the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008 under a public
MIT license.

Person?][1]

On Jan. 3, 2009, Bitcoin’s first block, known as the “genesis block,”
was mined. This marked the launch of the Bitcoin network, which
kickstarted the cryptocurrency and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) movement. Albeit the exact
figures remain unclear, from January to July 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto is
estimated to have mined over 1 million BTC. This means that at current
Bitcoin prices, it is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto is worth roughly
$54 billion.

In other words, if the price of Bitcoin hits $182,000, this would put
Nakamoto’s net worth at around $182 billion, which is higher than the
current net worth of Bezos. In 2010, Sergio Demian Lerner, a prominent
cryptocurrency researcher, published a research paper estimating the BTC
holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Can the price of BTC hit $182,000?  
While there are many price models that predict the price of Bitcoin to
reach anywhere between $200,000 to $1 million, the most well-known model
is the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. The S2F model forecasts the price of
Bitcoin to hit $100,000 to a “conservative” $288,000 by the end of 2021,
using a formula based on the relationship between the value of Bitcoin
versus the existing supply (stock) and the amount of newly mined BTC
entering the market (flow).

If Bitcoin rises to as high as $288,000 as per the S2F model, Satoshi’s
fortune would be worth around $288 billion, which should put the creator
far out in front of Bezos and Musk. Meanwhile, some other Bitcoin price
predictions have been even higher for the current bull cycle. For
instance, Bloomberg predicted that BTC could reach as high as $400,000
if it becomes a “risk-off” reserve asset. However, the identity of
Satoshi remains a mystery and it isn’t known whether the person(s) is
even alive today. Industry experts have suggested the likes of Hal
Finney, Adam Back, and Paul Le Roux as potential candidates, as well as
others presuming that it could have been a group of individuals.
