LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will focus first on regulating stablecoins
rather than the broader cryptocurrency market, its financial services
minister said on Tuesday, citing the threat to competition should any
major private effort dominate the emerging field.

Facebook Inc’s move in 2019 to introduce its own stablecoin Diem, then
known as Libra, raised concerns among governments and central banks that
a major payments competitor could emerge overnight.

> “We need to manage risks to competition,” John Glen told a City &
Financial conference.

>

> “There is the potential for some firms to swiftly achieve dominance
and crowd out other players, due to their ability to scale and plug into
existing online services,” Glen said.

>

> “We believe the case for intervention in the wider cryptocurrency
markets is less immediately pressing.”

Stablecoins such as the planned Diem, which is now run by an association
that includes Facebook and currently seeking approval in Switzerland,
are designed to avoid the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies like
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Stablecoins have become the largest component of cryptocurrencies by
trading volume, Glen said. While no globally systemic player has yet
emerged, he added, this could change rapidly.

The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation, Tether, is a fraction
of the size of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and little used for commerce. Most stablecoins
are used for trading and investment.

Glen said Britain would not hold back innovation or be protectionist
when it comes to using distributed ledger technology, which underpins
cryptocurrencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

> “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity here to make vast strides
in the efficiency of financial services, and ultimately benefit
consumers and the economy as a whole,” he said.

Separately, Britain’s financial watchdog said it would not be suitable
to impose existing electronic money - “e-money” - rules on stablecoins,
as some are backed by several currencies or other assets.

> “The e-money regime isn’t a perfect match for crypto,” said Alex Roy,
head of consumer distribution [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the Financial Conduct Authority,
at the same conference.

Britain’s e-money [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s authorise cashless payments with money
kept on a card or phone, or online.
