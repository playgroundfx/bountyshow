Visa Inc said on Monday it will allow the use of the cryptocurrency USD
Coin to settle transactions on its payment network, the latest sign of
growing acceptance of digital currencies by the mainstream financial
industry.

The company told Reuters it had launched the pilot program with payment
and crypto platform Crypto.com and plans to offer the option to more
partners later this year.

Bitcoin, the most popular crypto coin, jumped to a one-week high on the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), rising as much as 4.5% to $58,300 and heading back toward a
record-high above $61,000 hit earlier this month.

Visa subsequently confirmed the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in a statement.

The USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged
directly to the U.S. dollar.

Visa’s move comes as finance firms including BNY Mellon, BlackRock Inc
and Mastercard Inc take steps to make more use of cryptocurrencies for
investment and payment purposes.

Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk, a major proponent of cryptocurrencies, said
last week that customers can buy its electric vehicles with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
hoping to encourage more day-to- day use of the digital currency.

> “We see increasing demand from consumers across the world to be able
to access, hold and use digital currencies and we’re seeing demand from
our clients to be able to build products that provide that access for
consumers,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said.

Traditionally, if a customer chooses to use a Crypto.com Visa card to
pay for a coffee, the digital currency held in a cryptocurrency wallet
needs to be converted into traditional money.

The cryptocurrency wallet will deposit traditional fiat currency in a
bank account, to be wired to Visa at the end of the day to settle any
transactions, adding cost and complexity for businesses.

Visa’s latest step, which will use the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), strips out
the need to convert digital coin into traditional money in order for the
transaction to be settled.

Visa said it has partnered with digital asset bank Anchorage and
completed the first transaction this month — with Crypto.com sending
USDC to Visa’s Ethereum address at Anchorage.
