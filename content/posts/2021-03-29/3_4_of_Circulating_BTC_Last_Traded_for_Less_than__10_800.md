Research from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode has found that
roughly three-quarters of circulating Bitcoin last moved on the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) when prices were below $10,800, suggesting most market
participants are long-term holders. Glassnode’s March 29 ‘Week on Chain’
report found that 25.43% of circulating BTC last traded between the
prices of $10,800 and $58,800. With Bitcoin trading for $10,800 just six
months ago, the data suggests one-in-four circulating BTC last changed
hands during either Q2 2020 or Q1 2021.

The report notes the number of long-term Bitcoin bulls continues to
increase, with many coins that have remained dormant since early in the
current market cycle now being classified by Glassnode as long-term
holdings, or LTH — coins that have not moved on-chain for at least 155
days. As a result, the number of coins being classified as entering into
“illiquid supply” has surged in 2021. The Illiquid Supply Change metric
has shown that the 30-day change in supply is moving from a liquid or
readily traded state into an illiquid state representing HODLed coins.

The report observed that accumulation rates exceeding 130k BTC per month
has been consistently maintained throughout this bull market.
Glassnode’s Coin Days Destroyed metric, or CDD, also points to
increasing hodling among long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, with CDD suggesting
seasoned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are again realizing gains at a rate comparable to
2020 after a surge of profit-taking between November through January.
