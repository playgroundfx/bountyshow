Filecoin, the decentralized storage project designed by Protocol Labs
and built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), has seen
quite the demand during the last 90 days. During the last week, the
crypto asset has spiked 61%, while a number of other cryptocurrencies
have been down. At the time of publication, Filecoin is trading for $127
per unit and has a $7.54 billion market valuation. 30-day price
statistics show filecoin (FIL) is also up over 270% as well.

The Filecoin project aims to make it so people can control their own
data, and decentralize major cloud services like Amazon and Cloudflare.
The project launched in 2017 with lots of hype and it raised over $200
million in thirty minutes. As the hype gradually grew, on March 27, the
Filecoin team announced that FIL miners and Livepeer miners could co-
mine together. Filecoin mining has seen demand and just recently, the
computer hardware giant based in Shenzhen, Xinyuan Technology Co.
invested in filecoin miners.

Filecoin’s recent demand also derives from the recent announcement from
Grayscale Investments when the firm announced the launch of five new
trusts with filecoin (FIL) included. Since the Grayscale announcement,
FIL market prices have increased a great deal.
