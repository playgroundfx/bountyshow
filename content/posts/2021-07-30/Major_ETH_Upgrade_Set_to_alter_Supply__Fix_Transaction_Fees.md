NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum, the second-largest [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network, is
about to undergo a technical adjustment that will significantly alter
the way transactions are processed, as well as reduce the supply of the
ether token and sharply boost its price.

The scheduled coding revamp will go live on Aug. 4.

The upgrade known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is
similar, analysts said, to a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) “halving” event in which periodic
adjustments reduced the supply of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Each halving helped propel
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price to higher records.

While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is the preferred store of value in the digital ecosystem,
Ethereum has emerged as the leading financial infrastructure, settling
over $12 billion of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) transactions, according to a Grayscale report
released in February this year.

Andrew Keys, managing partner at DARMA Capital, said ether’s current
price has yet to factor in the looming software upgrade.

He estimates that the expected software adjustment next week, coupled
with another upgrade in the first quarter of 2022, should “easily
quintuple the price of ether” by next year. On Thursday, ether was up
0.6% at $2,312.

## WHAT IS EIP 1559?

EIP-1559 is a software upgrade that fundamentally changes the way
transactions are processed on Ethereum by providing clear pricing on
transaction fees in ether paid to miners to validate transactions and
“burning” a small amount of those tokens. The burned tokens will be
permanently taken out of circulation.

In token burning, miners would typically send the tokens to specialized
addresses that have unobtainable private keys. Without access to a
private key, no one can use the tokens, putting them outside the
circulating supply. By reducing the number of tokens, the currencies
that remain in circulation become rarer and more valuable.

## WHAT IS THE CURRENT PRACTICE ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN?

Currently, a person or entity trying to send a transaction on the
Ethereum network must pay a so-called “gas fee” in ether to miners to
process their transactions.

But the exact transaction fee is not clear and market participants say
there is no way of knowing the price beforehand.

This creates two issues, said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at
Bitwise Asset Management.

> “First, it introduces a major uncertainty around whether you’ll get
your transaction processed in a timely fashion,” he said. “Second,
people overpay because they don’t know the clearing price and they bid
too much to make sure the transaction is processed.”

## WILL MINING, BUYING AND SELLING ETHER BECOME EASIER?

EIP-1559 changes this mechanism by setting a “base fee” paid to miners
for each transaction, part of which will be burned. Participants can
also include an optional “tip” with their base fee to speed up the
process, if desired.

Another adjustment, market players said, is doubling the amount of space
available in each block. Blockchains like Ethereum settle transactions
in batches or blocks. Each block can contain only a certain number of
transactions.

Blocks are propagated on Ethereum every 17 seconds and EIP 1599 is going
to be deployed on Block 12,965,000, which is estimated to happen on Aug.
4, said DARMA’S Keys.

There was a bug bounty, which paid people if they found bugs. That has
process has been completed.

## WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ETHER SUPPLY?

Bitwise’s Hougan cited estimates that EIP-1599 will reduce ether’s
overall inflation rate from roughly 4% a year to 3%. That is about half
as large a reduction proportionately seen in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) “halving” events,
he said.

## WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INVESTORS?

The change should make it easier for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to understand the value
of holding ether. Hougan said EIP 1559 should increase transactions on
the Ethereum network and raise the use of ether, which will likely help
bring a wave of institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s into the market.
