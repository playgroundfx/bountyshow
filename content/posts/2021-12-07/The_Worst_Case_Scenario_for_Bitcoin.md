On Monday, along with rising risk appetite in global markets, buying
interest in cryptocurrencies returned. The cryptocurrency fear and greed
index added 9 points to 25 overnight. This is still an area of extreme
fear, but recent dynamics of the largest coins indicate that this is now
the moment for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with increased risk appetite to enter.

![The Worst-Case Scenario for Bitcoin][1]

BTCUSD has added 4.9% in the last 24 hours, trading just above the $51K
level.

The RSI on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) candlestick charts has retreated from below 30
(oversold area). The price has found support from buyers at the
important 200-day moving average. This is a strong signal for many
participants that the whole market stays in a long-term bullish phase.

But so far, we see very cautious buying, which is creating doubts. A
better signal would be a sharp move up, crossing this line, as in July
and October this year and before that in April 2020.

This is quite an optimistic scenario for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), where it gets
sustained bullish support, preventing it from descending into an
uncontrollable fall.

The pessimistic scenario for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and the entire cryptocurrency
market, assume a bullish/bearish sentiment tied to 4-year halving
cycles. The previous two bear markets came in 2014 and 2018, giving
speculators a good shake out of that train and leaving only the most
resilient crypto enthusiasts.

![The Worst-Case Scenario for Bitcoin][2]

A sharp reversal to the downside after a dizzying rise came in late 2013
and 2017 and lasted about a year. This suggests a high risk of reversal
at the end of 2021. From peak to bottom in 2013-2014, BTC lost more than
70%, and in 2017-2018 – 85%.

A repetition of these scales sets BTCUSD up for a pullback in the 10-20k
range. In our view, even a decline to 20k – the highs of the previous
cycle – looks like a very pessimistic scenario for now. But it may well
materialise under a negative set of circumstances, though it is bound to
attract the interest of long-term buyers.

Bitcoin needs to pass several checkpoints before we seriously consider
such a scenario. The first one is the 200-day moving average (currently
at 48k). Confirmation we will get on the decline under $40K, the level
of previous local lows.
