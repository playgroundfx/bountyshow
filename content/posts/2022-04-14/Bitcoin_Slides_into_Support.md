Bitcoin was down 3.4% on Thursday, ending the day near $39.9K, although
it managed to bounce back above $40.1K by Friday morning, cutting the
intraday decline to 2.8%. Ethereum has lost 2.5% in the last 24 hours,
and other leading altcoins from the top ten are predominantly declining,
from -1% (BNB) to -7.3% (Terra). The exception was XRP, which added 5.4%
during this time.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, decreased by 2.8% per day, to $1.87 trillion. The Bitcoin
dominance index fell by 0.3% to 40.7%.

By Friday, the cryptocurrency fear and greed index returned to the
extreme fear territory, losing 6 points to 22. US stocks failed to build
on the offensive, losing all the previous day’s gains, leading to a
stronger selloff for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) compared to alternative cryptocurrencies.

From the technical side, Bitcoin is trading near the support level,
which runs through the lows of January, February, and March. A formal
signal to break the support will be considered a failure under the
previous lows in the $38K area. The ability to develop a reversal to the
offensive from these levels, on the contrary, will reinforce the
importance of this moderate uptrend line.
