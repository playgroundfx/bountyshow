The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply after approaching $18,500 on
Binance and Coinbase. The plunge took place as large sell orders were
spotted on both spot and futures exchanges. As Cointelegraph previously
reported, traders anticipated a pullback as the price of BTC neared the
$18,000 to $19,000 resistance zone. Upon its first retest of the area in
nearly three years, the market saw a strong reaction.

Bitcoin confirms $18.5k as a key near-term resistance area  
There are two main reasons why Bitcoin saw a swift drop near $18,500,
and this caused other cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) to correct even
harder.

First, the $18,500 level remains the biggest resistance level before a
new all-time high above $20,000. Hence, it is a key area of interest for
sellers to defend, as breaching $18,500 would raise the chances of a
broader rally.

Second, an overwhelming majority of Bitcoin addresses are profitable as
BTC tests an important resistance area. According to IntoTheBlock, 99%
of BTC addresses are now in a state of profit. This raises the
probability of a profit-taking-induced pullback.

There is a high probability that dips would get aggressively bought,
based on BTC’s recovery in the past two hours. Following the initial
drop to $17,214 on Binance, Bitcoin immediately recovered above $17,600.

The hourly chart of Bitcoin shows that the 20-day moving average (MA)
hovers at $17,586. As such, if BTC remains comfortably above that level,
the likelihood of a prolonged recovery increases.

Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, expressed confidence in
Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. He said that the “big boys” or the smart
money would likely buy the dips. Referring to the weekly chart of
Bitcoin, he wrote:

> “Not often in life do you get to look at a chart like this one.
#Bitcoin to slice through highs imminently. 3rd wave up to dwarf the
2017 move and should persist for several years. Real fundamentals
driving price unlike ’17 speccy/ico retail flow. Big boys will buy dips
now.”
