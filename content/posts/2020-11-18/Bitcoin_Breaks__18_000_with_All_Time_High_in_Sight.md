Bitcoin broke through $18,000 on Wednesday to hit its highest since
December 2017 extending its blistering 2020 rally driven by demand for
its perceived quality as an inflation hedge and expectations of
mainstream acceptance.

The original and biggest cryptocurrency jumped as high as $18,483 and
was last up 2%. It has soared about 160% this year and has jumped 17% in
the last three days alone.

Bitcoin is now close to its all-time high of just under $20,000, which
it touched at the peak of its retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)-fuelled 2017 bubble.

> “It is not out of the question for the crypto to hit its all-time high
of $20,000 this side of Christmas,” said Simon Peters, analyst at
investment platform eToro.

> “The crypto industry has consolidated, matured and is seeing real
traction with institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Investors are using [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as an
inflationary hedge to combat the prospect of continued government
stimulus.”

The asset’s 12-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) has been peppered with vertiginous price
rises and equally sharp crashes.
