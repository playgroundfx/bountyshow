In another sign of renewed exuberance in cryptocurrency markets,
Grayscale Investments has broken above $10 billion in digital assets
under management for the first time.

Disclosed Tuesday evening, the New York-based firm now oversees $10.4
billion in assets including [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cash, ether, horizen, ether
classic, [Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/), stellar, XRP and zcash.

That’s up from $7.6 billion on Oct. 30, according to the firm’s November
report.  
Price appreciation in all cryptocurrencies this month is a factor behind
the growth, but so are inflows: Grayscale took in $262.3 million last
week alone, Managing Director Michael Sonnenshein tweeted Friday.

The assets are held across nine single-asset investment trusts and a
diversified fund. Shares in these vehicles are offered directly only to
accredited [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, but most of them can be publicly traded on the
over-the-counter markets.  
Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent
company of CoinDesk.
