Jan 22 (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped again on Saturday and was last down
around 4% for the day, hovering around the $35,000 level.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, is now about
half its $69,000 peak in November. It was last at $35,049, after falling
as low as $34,000 and following a steep fall on Friday.

The currency has had wild price swings and has been hit as risk appetite
has fallen on inflation fears and anticipation of a more aggressive pace
of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Other risk assets have fallen with stocks falling on Friday. The S&P 500
and Nasdaq recorded their biggest weekly percentage drops since the
start of the pandemic in March 2020.

In a research note on Friday, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the
Americas at OANDA, said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was falling as "crypto traders de-risk
portfolios following the bloodbath in stocks" and in advance of next
week's Federal Reserve [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.

> "Bitcoin remains in the danger zone and if $37,000 breaks, there is
not much support until the $30,000 level," Moya wrote on Friday.

Ether , the coin linked to the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network, dropped 6.7%
to $2,396 on Saturday.
