LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Bitcoin tumbled to its lowest level
in six months on Monday as fears of a Russian attack on Ukraine saw
riskier assets worldwide extend their sell-off.

The largest cryptocurrency was last down 5.4% at $34,310 after earlier
dropping to $32,951, its lowest price since July 23, taking losses from
its all-time high of $69,000 hit in November past 50%.

NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing
Eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, in what Russia
denounced as an escalation of tensions over Ukraine.

Fears of a conflict pummelled shares across the world while bolstering
the dollar and oil.

Nerves over the Federal Reserve's two-day [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting, starting on
Tuesday, added to the mix, with the U.S. central bank expected to
confirm it will soon start draining the pool of liquidity that has
supercharged growth stocks.

> "The story is really how aggressive is the tightening," said Marc
Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New
York, noting that a Fed move to reduce the size of its balance sheet
will tighten conditions along with higher interest rates.

Crypto currencies are falling along with other risk assets as "people
are pulling back on risk broadly," he added.

Smaller cryptocurrencies, which tend to move in tandem with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
also slumped. Ether , the second-largest digital coin, was last down 11%
at $2,257 after earlier reaching $2,160, its lowest level since July 27.

More than $400 million in crypto assets has been liquidated in the past
24 hours, according to data from Coinglass, with Bitcoin trades
accounting for $141 million of that total.

> "Bitcoin will face headwinds going back up until the macroeconomic
conditions change," said Mark Elenowitz, president of Horizon, a firm
that services securities exchanges.

>

> "Generally speaking, when rates are hiked, we could see more sell-offs
of seemingly risk-on assets like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)."

U.S.-listed cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital and
Bit Digital slumped between 9% and 17% on Monday, while crypto exchange
Coinbase Global dropped 13.3%.
