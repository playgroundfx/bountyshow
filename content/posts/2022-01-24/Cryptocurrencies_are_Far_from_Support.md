The cryptocurrency fear and greed index was down to 11 on Sunday and
slightly up to 13 by early Monday. Crypto market capitalisation lost
another 1.1% overnight to $1.61 trillion, the lowest since August.

As is often the case with prolonged sell-offs, altcoins are falling with
acceleration to the first cryptocurrency, causing BTC’s share gains,
which already stands at 41.3% against lows of 39.3% in mid-January.
Bitcoin’s share of 40% seems like a turning point, twice triggering a
correction in the crypto market.

This level stood like an informal threshold that optimism about altcoins
had gone too far.

However, the rise in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s share does little to help its price. We
saw the sixth consecutive bearish [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) candlestick on Monday morning,
and the price rolled back to $35K. The bears may well be able to sell
the price down to $32.5K, closing the gap of July and returning the rate
to last summer’s support area.

Alarmingly, the sharp reversal on Friday was not followed by any
meaningful bounce. Some observers point out that this is a worrying
signal, suggesting further market declines, as we have not seen a final
capitulation. Without capitulation, the markets will remain with an
overhang of sellers.

The price of ether has fallen to $2400, which is less than half of its
peak price in November.

Events are developing in a bearish scenario, so far broadly repeating
what we saw in 2018 in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of overall sentiment. Long-term buyers can
avoid buying at prices above 30k for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and 2k for ether.

We believe long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will look out for purchases in the 20-30k
per [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) area. Whether these purchases will be at the upper or lower
boundary depends, among other things, on the situation in the stock
markets. The return of buyers there will support the demand for risk
among institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. But as long as we see only steady selling
from them, it is too early to talk about buying.
