With a sharp decline over the weekend, Bitcoin wiped out the initial
weekly gains, giving bears the upper hand for the third straight week.
There were drawdowns to $34K on the low-liquid market on Saturday and
Sunday. So the rate of the first cryptocurrency fell to $38K with a 3.8%
loss. However, over the past 24 hours, BTC has reached $39,000 while
Ethereum has lost 4.5%. Other leading altcoins from the top ten decline
from 2% (XRP) to 6.8% (LUNA).

According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market decreased by 3.8%, to $1.71 trillion. The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dominance index
sank from 42.9% on Friday to 42.3% due to the sale of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) over the
weekend.

The cryptocurrency fear and greed index is at 23 now, remaining in a
state of “extreme fear”. Looking back, in the middle of the week, the
index had a moment in the neutral position.

The sales were triggered by reports that the BTC.com pool banned the
registration of Russian users. Cryptocurrencies do not remain aloof from
politics, hardly confirming the role of an alternative to the banking
system now, supporting EU and US sanctions against Russia, and showing
their initiative. The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) appeared that Switzerland would freeze the
crypto assets of the Russians who fall under the sanctions.

In the second half of the week, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) lost almost all the growth
against the backdrop of a decline in stock indices. Although last week
started on a positive wave: BTC added nearly $8,000 (21%) since the
previous Monday but couldn’t overcome the strong resistance of mid-
February highs at around $45,000 and the 100-day moving average.
Speaking about the prospects, pressure on all risky assets will continue
to be exerted by the situation around Ukraine, where hostilities have
been taking place for two weeks.

Worth mentioning that the world-famous [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) and writer Robert
Kiyosaki said that the US is “destroying the dollar” and called for
investing in gold and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

At the same time, the founder of the investment company SkyBridge
Capital (Anthony Scaramucci) is confident that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will reach
$100,000 by 2024. Now, he has invested about $1 billion in BTC. Plis, a
group of American senators, develops a bill that opens access to the
crypto market for institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. And one more piece of [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) to
consider: the city of Lugano in Switzerland has recognized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and
the leading stablecoin Tether (USDT) as legal tender.
