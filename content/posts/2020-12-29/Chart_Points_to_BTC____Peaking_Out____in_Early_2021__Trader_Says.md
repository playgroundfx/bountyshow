Bitcoin could be headed for a breather in the new year. The red-hot
cryptocurrency continued its longest monthly win streak in more than a
year on Monday after grazing a new all-time above the $28,000 mark on
Sunday. Based on the charts, that run might be put on pause come 2021,
Mark Newton, founder and president of Newton Advisors, told CNBC’s
“Trading Nation” on Monday. “It is still quite bullish on an
intermediate-term basis given that it just broke out to new all-time
highs,” Newton said. “I think we have a ways to go. Near term, my cycle
composite shows us peaking out in early January.”

Bitcoin’s weekly chart and relative strength index reflect rising
interest in the world’s largest digital currency, mostly from
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Newton said. Google searches for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) are up
some 750% year over year, but still “nowhere near” their highs from
2017, the chart analyst said. ″[With] SPACs right now, you can make
money at 10, 15, 20% a day,” he said. “I just don’t think that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
have quite the appetite for crypto while the institutions are certainly
very much heading in that direction.”

Newton’s other chart — which uses three different [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cycles, the
main one being 273 days, to track changes in the cryptocurrency’s path —
hints at an upcoming turn in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s direction. “All those years where
we had a stellar Q4 we reversed course in trend back in late December,
early January, and actually went lower,” he said. “So, I think there
will be some opportunity [for] [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to be able to buy dips in
crypto and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) particularly.” Newton, who is long [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/),
[Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/) and several other digital currencies, said he would look to
sell out of his positions “in the next one or two weeks.” “I think there
will be some opportunity to buy dips into Q1 of next year,” he said.

Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset
Management, said the institutional interest in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) “bodes well for
the asset.” “Can it go to $50,000? Absolutely,” he said in the same
“Trading Nation” interview, cautioning that “if you are looking to trade
or invest this asset, you have to have the mentality that it’s going to
have a huge amount of volatility.”
