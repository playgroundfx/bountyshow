Major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Coinbase will suspend trading for XRP in
response to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission taking
legal action against Ripple. According to a blog post published today by
Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the exchange will fully
suspend XRP trading starting on Jan. 19 at 10:00 am PST. Coinbase
clarified that “trading may be halted earlier as needed” to maintain the
exchange’s market health metrics. In addition, the suspension will
reportedly not affect Ripple-backed Flare Network’s upcoming Spark (FLR)
token airdrop.

The U.S.-based exchange is the largest so far to take a position on XRP
following the Dec. 22 announcement that the SEC will charge Ripple, CEO
Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen with conducting an
“unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.”

Earlier today, crypto exchange OKCoin announced that it will suspend XRP
trading and deposits beginning on Jan. 4. Bitstamp stated it will halt
XRP trading for U.S. residents, while smaller exchanges including OSL,
Beaxy and CrossTower announced they will take similar actions against
trading the token.

Some crypto users are anticipating other exchanges falling in line like
dominoes to delist or suspend trading of XRP now that a major player
like Coinbase has taken a position on the token.

Following the Coinbase announcement, the price of XRP immediately
dropped more than 10%, falling from $0.28 to $0.25 at the time of
publication. This is the latest in a series of bearish movements for the
token, the price of which has fallen 44% since the SEC announcement.
