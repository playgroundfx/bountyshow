Bitcoin (BTC) will “explode” in price once it hits $13,000, one trader
believes as Bitcoin futures trade at 6% above spot price. In a tweet on
Aug. 18, the derivatives trader JSterz highlighted “extreme” Bitcoin
futures spreads as a sign that an intensely strong bullish advance may
soon arrive.

Currently, Bitcoin futures contracts expiring in March 2021 are priced
6% higher than the BTC/USD spot price at around $12,280. “It seems
extreme to see BTC-Mar21 trading 6% above spot,” JSterz summarized.  
“We have been at this level about four times since 2017. If #BTC
breaches 13k this thing is going to explode.”

Open interest for a basket of trading platforms hit new all-time highs
on Monday, beating a previous record from mid-February, before March’s
coronavirus-induced crash. “Note the changes in market share of OI,”
Ikigai fund manager Travis Kling commented, uploading an overview chart
to Twitter.

Institutional investment in Bitcoin remains a major topic of
conversation among supporters this month, following a dramatic buy-in
from multibillion-dollar MicroStrategy in late July.

Asset manager Grayscale has seen record investment in its various
cryptocurrency funds, as Bitcoin outperforms gold as a fiat hedge.

On Monday, a sudden swing above $12,000 was assumed to be a red herring,
but the higher levels have since held.
