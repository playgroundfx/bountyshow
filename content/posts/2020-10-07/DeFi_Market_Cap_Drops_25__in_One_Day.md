The DeFi markets took a sharp downturn yesterday, with the combined
capitalization of DeFi assets falling 25% while volumes shrunk 30%. The
decentralized finance (DeFi) bubble continues to deflate, with crypto
market data firm Sentiment reporting a 25% crash in the market
capitalization of DeFi assets during yesterday alone.

![DeFi Market Cap Drops 25% in One Day][1]

In a blog post published Oct. 8, Santiment estimated that [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) DeFi
token trade volumes have fallen by 30% combined, while recent market
leaders Sushi (SUSHI), Uniswap (UNI) and Yearn Finance (YFI) are among
the hardest hit with weekly losses of 51%, 38% and 31% respectively.

Despite noting that crypto-Twitter has already emphatically declared the
death of the entire DeFi experiment, Santiment claims to have identified
“whale accumulation” activity taking place around several DeFi assets
including Synthetix (SNX).

Santiment also noted that the combined value of DeFi assets at the time
they last moved on the MVRV [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) has dropped to an all-time low,
“indicating undervaluation” at current price levels. Recently launched
DeFi indexes slumped to record lows this past week, with Binance
Futures’ DeFi Composite Index crashing 20% yesterday. The index has now
fallen 63% from its first day of trading in late August. TokenSet’s DeFi
Pulse Index (DPI) also fell 20% yesterday, slumping to tag a record low
of $71 — posting a near 50% retracement since launching four weeks ago.
