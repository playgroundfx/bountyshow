NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Cybercriminals laundered $8.6 billion in
cryptocurrencies last year, up 30% from 2020, according to a report from
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analysis firm Chainalysis released on Wednesday.

Overall, cybercriminals have laundered more than $33 billion worth of
crypto since 2017, Chainalysis estimated, with most of the total over
time moving to centralized exchanges.

The firm said the sharp rise in money laundering activity in 2021 was
not surprising, given the significant growth of both legitimate and
illegal crypto activity last year.

Money laundering refers to that process of disguising the origin of
illegally obtained money by transferring it to legitimate businesses.

About 17% of the $8.6 billion laundered went to decentralized finance
applications, Chainalysis said, referring to the sector which
facilitates crypto-denominated financial transactions outside of
traditional banks.

That was up from 2% in 2020.

Mining pools, high-risk exchanges, and mixers also saw substantial
increases in value received from illicit addresses, the report said.
Mixers typically combine potentially identifiable or tainted
cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to conceal the trail to the
fund's original source.

Wallet addresses associated with theft sent just under half of their
stolen funds, or more than $750 million worth of crypto in total, to
decentralized finance platforms, according to the Chainalysis report.

Chainalysis also clarified that the $8.6 billion laundered last year
represents funds derived from crypto-native crime such as darknet market
sales or ransomware attacks in which profits are in crypto instead of
fiat currencies.

> "It's more difficult to measure how much fiat currency derived from
off-line crime — traditional drug trafficking, for example — is
converted into cryptocurrency to be laundered," Chainalysis said in the
report.

> "However, we know anecdotally this is happening."
