The price of meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) soared more than 55%
Sunday, setting a new all-time high, after American rapper Snoop Dogg
joined DOGE booster-in-chief Elon Musk and Kiss rock star Gene Simmons
in tweeting a meme of a Shiba Inu, the dog breed that represents the
DOGE token.

The price of the cryptocurrency started trading around $0.056 at the
beginning of the day and rose to $0.0872 Sunday afternoon before
settling back to $0.084, up 55%, in the last 24 hours, eclipsing the
all-time high of $0.078 set late last month. Year to date DOGE is up
more than 1,380%.

Hours after Dogg’s Tweet, Musk, who, when he’s not busy boosting DOGE
also serves as Tesla’s CEO, tweeted a Lion King-inspired picture of
himself holding up Simmons holding up Snoop Dogg who in turn is holding
up a Shiba Inu.

The Tweets by the trio of DOGE lovers apparently were enough to cause
the meme-based cryptocurrency to rise four spots on the list of the most
valuable cryptocurrencies into seventh place, racing past Bitcoin Cash
(11), Chainlink (10), Litecoin (9) and BNB (8). DOGE now has a current
market value of $10.8 billion. Pop music star Kevin Jonas also added his
support for the cryptocurrency with a Tweeted Saturday evening.
