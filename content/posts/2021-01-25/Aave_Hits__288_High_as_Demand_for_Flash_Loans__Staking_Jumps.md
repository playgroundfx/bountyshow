Aave (AAVE) price has been on an absolute tear for weeks and today the
DeFi-token rallied to a new all-time high at $288.90. The decentralized
finance protocol is one of the most popular in the market and the recent
rally in the DeFi sector is one of the driving forces behind AAVE’s
rally.

![Aave \(AAVE\) price has been on an absolute tear for weeks and today
the DeFi-token rallied to a new all-time high at $288.90. The
decentralized finance protocol is one of the most popular in the market
and the recent rally in the DeFi sector is one of the driving forces
behind AAVE’s rally.][1]

Data from DeFi Pulse shows that Aave’s TVL rose from $2.03 billion on
Jan. 1 and as (BTC) and Ether (ETH) price went parabolic Aave’s TVL also
surged. Currently, Aave’s TVL sits at a new all-time high of $3.75
billion, making the platform the second-largest DeFi platform by TVL
behind Maker (MKR). The steady addition of new tokens to the lending and
borrowing protocol increases the likelihood that its TVL will continue
to rise and help AAVE retain its standing as one of the top DeFi
projects in the cryptocurrency space.

Another reason for AAVE’s recent surge is the growth of its flash loans.
Flash loans allow cryptocurrency holders to collatoralize their
portfolio to fund other purchases or new crypto purchases. The loans
also help [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s utilize the value in their tokens without the need
to sell see them and create a taxable event. Since launching flash loans
less than 12 months ago, more than $1.7 billion have been issued and
it’s expected that this figure will increse as the crypto bull market
progresses.
