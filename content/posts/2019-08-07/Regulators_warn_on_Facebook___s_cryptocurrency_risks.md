fears regarding the privacy risks associated with Facebook’s
cryptocurrency project.

In a joint statement, which was published recently by the U.K. ICO, data
privacy commissioners from a lot of countries, shared their opinion that
Facebook has still failed to specify how concretely one planned to
secure personal data.

Owing to the fact, that Libra is going on the near future to launch the
information about data security is yet unavailable.

Moreover the privacy commissioners draw up a question list that Facebook
is awaited to meet, including the issue whether the Libra Network plans
to announce officially on how their personal information will be secured
and may be used by project participants and if this Facebook’s service
presupposes the default privacy setting, that will not use “dark
schemes” to encourage users to share their personal data with third
parties or some[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) dampen their privacy data defense.

The last, but not the least question in that list is what information
amount would be needed for the service and what are the guarantees of
lawfulness of the data processing.

Facebook's shares went down on Wednesday by 1.47 percent at 13.53 GMT.
