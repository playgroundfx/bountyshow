Digital-asset traders and analysts were scrambling Tuesday to assess a
fresh data point extracted from the Bitcoin [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/): Some $806
million worth of the cryptocurrency apparently transferred earlier in
the day off of the Coinbase exchange’s institution-focused unit,
Coinbase Pro. The jury is out on what it means. It could be that a large
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) or several just completed a fresh round of buying and now are
taking the bounty off the exchange for long-term holding or other
purposes. Or it might be something else more innocuous, such as an
internal transfer.

Purchase][1]

According to data provided by the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analytics firm CryptoQuant,
some 14,666 BTC were moved off the exchange during the early U.S. hours
in a small number of transactions. The transfer came after [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
prices tumbled Monday by the most in a month to about $54,000, a level
the market hasn’t seen for almost two weeks. By Tuesday, the largest
cryptocurrency had steadied and was changing hands around $55,000.

Coinbase’s cold wallets for custody are directly integrated with the
exchange’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions and large traders
typically trade via OTC desks to avoid influencing the market price too
much. Hence, outflows from Coinbase Pro are often taken to represent
institutional demand for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). CryptoQuant found itself at the center
of a controversy last week, when one of its [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-data alerts
signaled an apparent transfer of $1.1 billion in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) onto the
Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange, possibly indicating big selling
pressure ahead. A backlash resulted on Twitter, with some posters
arguing the data was mislabeled or misinterpreted. Bitcoin is currently
trading near $55,000, having dropped to a low of $53,031 during the
Asian hours.
