After a stormy August, the most famous digital currency, Bitcoin, seems
to recover in September, jumping from $9,600 to $10,424 this month. As
one can see, Bitcoin hovers above the $10,000 threshold—a value it
achieved last time in July 2019.

Bitcoin leads the market in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its value increase, having thus
added more than 5 percent in 24 hours. One should mention, that the
other cryptocurrencies are also gaining in the range of 1-4 percent.

Bitcoin increased its market capitalization by more than $10 billion in
the last 24 hours to reach almost $187 billion. This growth period
pushed Bitcoin to dominate the market already by 70.5 percent,
surpassing the prior figure of 70.2 percent, recorded in March 2017.

In addition, Bitcoin trade volume picked up from $11 billion to $18.7
billion in the past 3 days.

Being more precisely, one can talk about a 2.66 percent jump in
Bitcoin’s value, to $10,684 at 13.16 GMT on Tuesday. The rates of other
digital currencies are as follows:

  * Ethereum went down by 0.44 percent, to $179.27;

  * Ripple advanced 0.15 percent, to $0.2633;

  * Bitcoin Cash gained 1.91 percent, to $1.91;

  *  Litecoin surged by 2.38 percent, to $69.33.

The Bitcoin growth can be a result of Bakkt's launch of its physically
settled Bitcoin futures platform, scheduled on September 23, 2019,
consider some experts.
