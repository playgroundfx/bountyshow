Money being pulled out of digital-asset investment funds slowed somewhat
last week. However, while net redemptions from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-focused funds
shrank, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seem to be souring on ether.

Overall, digital-asset funds experienced net outflows of $21 million
during the week ending June 11, down from $94 million pulled out of
funds the prior week, according to a Monday report by CoinShares.

The decline in outflows might be an early sign of bearishness has
peaked. Investors have been pulling money from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) funds in recent
weeks as the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value traded
below $40,000, down from the all-time high near $65,000 reached in
April.
