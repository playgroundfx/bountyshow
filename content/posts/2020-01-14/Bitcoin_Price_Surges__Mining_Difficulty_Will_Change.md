The planned correction of the Bitcoin mining complexity will be one of
the most significant one in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/): it will increase by almost 9
percent. Complexity is the number of decisions needed to find a solution
below an established level.

Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks depending on the mining
complexity of the previous set of blocks. If it increases, then one can
presuppose it was too low in the previous blocks.

The concept of complexity is necessary to keep [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) under review. If
you find the block easily enough, the output volume will increase
sharply. But if it is too hard, the miners will give up.

It is curious that this scheme of self-correction was laid down in the
system out of hand, taking into consideration the fact that market
conditions will change, as well as the number of those, who will become
miners, to say nothing of engineering capabilities. The only way to
consider all the possible variables is to use the difficulty adjustment.

After adjustment, the complexity will touch 15 trillion. This is about
three times more than in December 2018, when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was at its low of
around $3,100. The new indicator is also likely to be correlated with a
7 percent difficulty drop in November.

How will this affect the Bitcoin price?

The growth of miners number and boosted activity reflect the strong
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) spread. When users actively work, the total available number of
coins decreases as the demand jumps. The decline of available coins
causes the deficit and, ultimately, leads to prices growth.

Nonetheless, the other factors must be also considered, including the
new mining equipment appearance, as it could boost the increasing the
hashes number, reducing thus the generation of blocks and ultimately
enhancing the difficulty. This should not affect the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rate.

Meanwhile, the growing difficulty creates problems for miners,
especially before halving. When the reward for a block drops, the
generating process price, in fact, doubles.

In this context, the increased difficulty may bring miners to sell their
coins much more quickly, leading to the cryptocurrencies glut, and
prices, accordingly, will tumble.

As for the cryptocurrencies rate on Tuesday they are as follows:

  * Bitcoin surged by 6.31 percent, to $8,646;

  * Ethereum soared by 6.93 percent, to $154,54;

  * Ripple added 5.79 percent, to $0,2242;

  * Bitcoin Cash jumped by 12.85 percent, to $302,20;

  * Litecoin grew by 12.19 percent, to $55,9600 at 1422 GMT.
