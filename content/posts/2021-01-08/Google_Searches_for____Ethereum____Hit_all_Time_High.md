More people are searching for the word “Ethereum” now than ever before
in its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Google Trends reveals that the number of Google searches
currently being performed for “Ethereum” is at an all-time high,
eclipsing search interest during the height of the last ETH bull run.
Ethereum’s previous peak in search term popularity was on Jan. 13, 2018
— the date of ETH’s all-time high of $1,432.88.

![Google Searches for ‘Ethereum’ Hit all-Time High][1]

Historically considered a “folk metric,” a rising Google Analytics
interest score for a crypto search term is associated with positive
sentiment for that particular coin/project. While it makes sense that
search interest on Ethereum would peak during the run-up to a new all-
time high, the same can’t be said for searches of “Bitcoin,” which
remain at just 65% of its peak popularity on Dec. 23, 2017. That said,
many more people are searching for “Bitcoin” rather than “Ethereum” by a
ratio of approximately 5:1. An increase in popularity for various crypto
search [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) could potentially spawn a self-perpetuating bull run as
curious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s make purchases, fueling the price upward, and thus
sparking more interest, resulting a greater number of searches.

Here are some cryptocurrency-related keywords along with their current
interest expressed as a percentage of peak interest, which for most
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) was in Dec. 2017 or Jan. 2018:

Ethereum: 100%  
DeFi: 90%  
Ethereum Classic: 87%  
Crypto trading: 84%  
Bitcoin: 65%  
DApp: 63%  
Digital currency: 60%  
Vitalik Buterin: 56%  
Tether: 45%  
XRP: 42%  
Satoshi: 42%  
Smart contract: 41%  
Blockchain: 41%  
Cryptocurrency: 29%  
Litecoin: 14%  
Bitcoin Cash: 9%  
Most of the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) above have been increasing in search frequency over
the last few weeks.
