Bitcoin slipped more than 3% on Friday after Tesla boss Elon Musk fired
off a tweet hinting at a breakup with the cryptocurrency, though it
remains on course for its best weekly gain in about a month as it tries
to recover from May’s crash.

Bitcoin was last down about 3.6% at $37,809. Musk tweeted “#Bitcoin” and
a heartbreak emoji above a meme appearing to show a couple discussing
their breakup. Bitcoin is up 6.3% this week.

Musk has been a major promoter of cryptocurrencies but has turned
critical of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) since suspending Tesla plans to take it in payment
for cars owing to concerns about its energy use.
