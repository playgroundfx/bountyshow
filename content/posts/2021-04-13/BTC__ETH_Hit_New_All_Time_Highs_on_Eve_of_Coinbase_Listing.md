Bitcoin and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, surged to new all-
time high prices on Tuesday, the day before U.S.-based exchange
Coinbase’s highly anticipated listing on Nasdaq. Prices for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
(BTC), the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value, rose
as high as $63,191.37, topping the previous peak price of $61,453
observed about a month ago, based on CoinDesk 20 data.

![BTC, ETH Hit New All-Time Highs on Eve of Coinbase Listing][1]

Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and the
second-largest overall, set a new high water mark of $2,221.15, topping
the previous high of $2,190 set early Saturday morning. In recent
trading, the price of ETH was at $2,120.04, up 3.29% in the last 24
hours and almost 200% year to date.

Analysts had signaled that the extra publicity and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)-relations
chatter surrounding the Coinbase listing might lead to an uptick in the
pace of cryptocurrency adoption, or at the very least, speculation. Such
heightened demand comes at a time when data extracted from the Bitcoin
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) appear to show more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s pulling the cryptocurrency down
from big exchanges, ostensibly a sign they might be moving their
holdings offline for the long term and have little intention of selling.

In recent trading, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price had given back some of its gains,
trading at $62,757.59, up 4.55% over the last 24 hours and more than
100% year to date. The rally comes after weeks of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading
sluggishly in a narrow range below $60,000. Analysts projections for
COIN’s listing are ranging from $19 billion to $230 billion, as
discussed last week.

COIN shares will provide traditional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exposure to a crypto
platform that earns money from fees while avoiding the volatility and
risk of crypto assets themselves. “Coinbase will be a lower beta play,”
Delphi Digital’s Kevin Kelly told Bloomberg. The exchange recently
disclosed Q1 revenue growth of 840% year-on-year, blowing past analysts’
estimates by a big margin.
