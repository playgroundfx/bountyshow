Bitcoin’s share of total cryptocurrency market value has fallen to its
lowest level in two years after strong rallies from some of the
industry’s biggest altcoins, including XRP and [Binance](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/binance-creator/) coin. The market
dominance of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), or the largest cryptocurrency’s value as a share
of the overall market, has dropped to about 55%, the lowest since April
2019, according to cryptocurrency research firms Messari and CoinGecko.
That’s down from about 70% at the start of the year.

The decline iwas driven in recent weeks by powerful rallies in the likes
of [Binance](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/binance-creator/) coin (BNB) and XRP (XRP), since [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s market value has
held steady at around $1 trillion or slightly above. The trend offers a
reminder of just how much money is flowing these days into digital
assets beyond [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), even as the big exchange Coinbase prepares this
week for a public stock listing aimed at traditional-market [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

XRP, the digital token used in Ripple Labs’ payment network, doubled in
the seven days through Sunday, its best weekly performance in more than
three years. The market value is between $50 billion and $140 billion,
depending on how one calculates it. Meanwhile, ether (ETH), the native
cryptocurrency of the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and the second-biggest
overall, recently climbed to a new all-time near $2,200, according to
CoinDesk 20 data. It has a market capitalization of about $250 billion,
as prices nearly tripled this year.

Filecoin (FIL) has climbed seven-fold this year to a market cap around
$11 billion, and theta token (THETA) has surged six-fold to about $12
billion. Even dogecoin (DOGE), which was launched in 2013 as little more
than a joke, has seen its price increase 12-fold this year, for a market
value of about $9 billion.
