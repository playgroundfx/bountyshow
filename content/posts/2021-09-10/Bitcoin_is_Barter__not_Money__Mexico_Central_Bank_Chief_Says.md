MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Bitcoin is more like a means of barter than
“evolved” fiat money, Mexico’s central back chief said on Thursday,
calling it a high-risk investment and a poor store of value.

Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon’s comments suggest Mexico
will not be following El Salvador any time soon in adopting the digital
currency as parallel legal tender.

> “Whoever receives [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in exchange for a good or service, we
believe that (transaction) is more akin to bartering because that person
is exchanging a good for a good, but not really money for a good,” said
Diaz de Leon.

> “In our times, money has evolved to be fiat money issued by central
banks,” he said. “Bitcoin is more like a dimension of precious metals
than [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) legal tender.”

The Banxico boss argued that in order for a cryptocurrency to be
considered money it must be a reliable payment method. He added that
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would also need to safeguard its value.

Diaz de Leon pointed out that the value of cryptocurrencies have often
swung wildly in a single day.

> “People will not want their purchasing power, their salary to go up or
down 10% from one day to another. You don’t want that volatility for
purchasing power. In that sense, it is not a good safeguard of value,”
he said.

The unprecedented adoption of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) earlier this week as legal tender
by El Salvador has been beset by problems that have contributed to a
rout in the value of the digital currency globally.

Bitcoin has been notoriously volatile. In April it rose to over $64,000
and fell almost as low as $30,000 in May.

It last traded up 2.44% at $47,179.04.
