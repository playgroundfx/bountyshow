The Crypto Fear and Greed Index remains at 24 for the third day, on the
extreme fear territory.

However, such a low index reading this time does little to describe the
dynamics of a market whose total capitalisation has been moving between
$1.95 trillion and $2.00 trillion since Tuesday.

![Bitcoin’s move Beyond $40-45K will Determine Further Trend][1]

Bitcoin has gained 0.4% in the past 24 hours to $41.9K, mainly ignoring
the decline in US stock indices following Wednesday’s results.

Buying on declines below $41K is not yet a cause for optimism, as a
downtrend with lower highs has been underway for more than a week.

According to technical analysis, this is often followed by a pullback.
But reversal patterns are not excluded when the bulls break through the
downside resistance. In our case, the signal of an upside reversal would
be stabilisation above $45K.

Local positive dynamics in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether were offset by a pullback
in Cardano and a further dip in Solana within the weekly trend.

While buying sentiment is strong among market participants on the stock
market decline, bulls in cryptocurrencies are also not giving up
psychologically significant support levels, now at $40K for Bitcoin and
$3K for Ether. A consolidation below them could be a harbinger of an
acceleration in fall.

The outcome of this confrontation today could be determined by the
dynamics of the stock markets, where the key indices – the Nasdaq 100
and Dow Jones 30 – have corrected to their 200-day moving averages.
