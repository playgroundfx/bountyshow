Jan 20 (Reuters) - Robinhood Markets IncÂ is rolling out [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/)s
to a 1,000 users, allowing them to send and receive cryptocurrencies
through their brokerage accounts, the company said in a blog post on
Thursday.

The Menlo Park-based online brokerage had laid out plans to begin
testing cryptocurrency wallets last year, with the aim of a broader
rollout in 2022.

Out of nearly 1.6 million people on a waitlist for the [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/),
the top 1,000 selected can now exchange their crypto from Robinhood with
external [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/)s.

The new feature also connects holders of the digital asset to the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) ecosystem.

Beta testers will have a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) limit of $2,999 in total withdrawals and
10 transactions, and will need to enable two-factor authentication, the
company said.

Robinhood, which benefited from a boom in retail trading during the
pandemic, expects to expand the program to 10,000 customers by March.

Its customers have long asked for [crypto wallet](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-wallet-with-free-coins/)s, which allow broader
participation in [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-based ecosystems, such as buying virtual
assets like non-fungible tokens (NTFs) on the Ethereum network.

The company is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.
