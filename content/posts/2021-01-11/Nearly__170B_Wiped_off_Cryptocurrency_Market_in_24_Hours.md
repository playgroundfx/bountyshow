  * Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell over 11% from a day earlier to $35,828.06, at around 12:15 p.m. Singapore time.

GUANGZHOU, China — Bitcoin and other digital coins tanked on Monday
wiping off some $170 billion from the entire cryptocurrency market.

The market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market was
$959.53 billion at 12:10 p.m. Singapore time, down from $1.1 trillion a
day earlier, according to Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell over 11% from a day earlier to
$35,828.06, at around 12:15 p.m. Singapore time. Ether, the second-
largest, was down around 15% to $1,126.72.

The sell-off in cryptocurrencies comes after a huge rally and perhaps
signals some profit-taking from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Bitcoin is still up over 340%
in the last 12-months and last week hit an all-time high just below
$42,000.

Bitcoin’s resurgence has been attributed to a number of factors
including more buying from large institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

And it has also been likened to “digital gold,” a potential safe-haven
asset and a hedge against inflation. In a recent research note, JPMorgan
said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could hit $146,000 in the long term as it competes with
gold as an “alternative” currency. The investment bank’s strategists
noted, however, that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would have to become substantially less
volatile to reach this price. Bitcoin is known for wild price swings.

But some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) critics — such as David Rosenberg, economist and
strategist at Rosenberg Research — have called [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) a bubble.

Long-term bullishness around [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) remains however. Last week, Social
Capital’s Chamath Palihapitiya said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could go above $100,000.

> “It’s probably going to $100,000, then $150,000, then $200,000,”
Palihapitiya told CNBC’s “Halftime Report.” “In what period? I don’t
know. [Maybe] five or 10 years, but it’s going there.”
