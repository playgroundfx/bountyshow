Analysts predict that the imminent launch of yETH by Yearn Finance could
trigger a renewed surge in buying pressure on the ETH markets. The
product, which is being voted on by YFI token holders, will
automatically find the highest yielding decentralized finance (DeFi)
protocol/strategy for Ether (ETH) deposits.

![Yearn Finance’s ETH Vault Could Spark Ethereum Bull Run][1]

Yearn Finance’s core products are ‘vaults’ that seek the best returns
for yield farmers, while also pooling funds to reduce gas fees. With
Yearn’s vault purporting to guarantee the highest returns while removing
the labor and research needed to maximize the profitability of yield
farming, combined with hype around the brand, the yETH vault is expected
to drive up demand for ETH.

Some members of the crypto community speculate that guaranteed premium
yields may attract capital that might have otherwise been designated for
Ether staking in phase 0 of the ETH 2.0 rollout.

Nuggets News founder Alex Saunders also believes that yETH has major
potential: The new product that has me excited & even more bullish on
ETH, is yETH. This adds to a long list of catalysts for Ethereum, but it
also reduces the available supply. Anyone who owns ETH can earn the best
yield automatically by HODLing yETH  
However, some crypto media outlets reporting that Yearn Finance’s Ether
‘vault’ was voted into existence last night, a thread on the project’s
governance forum suggests the vote is yet to have taken place — with
user ‘Juanma’ describing reports of yETH’s launch as “clickbait.”

Yearn Finance’s founder Andre Cronje tweeted on August 21 that the first
community built strategy for an ETH vault was “coming soon.” Then, on
August 31, the Twitter account of DeFi Farmer John announced yETH had
launched after a test candidate for the project had been deployed.

However, Yearn developer Banteg replied, stating: “There will almost
certainly be another deployment since we’ve already identified a few
things to improve.”

Despite YFI’s massive price relative to other cryptocurrencies, Saunders
believes many traders are underestimating the room that YFI still has to
grow given its maximum supply of just 30,000 tokens.

Messari’s Ryan Watkins similarly asserted that people are “being too
conservative with their YFI targets,” offering $1 billion as a somewhat
tongue-in-cheek price target.

Yearn Finance is currently the sixth-ranked DeFi protocol with $792
million in locked funds according to DeFi Pulse.
