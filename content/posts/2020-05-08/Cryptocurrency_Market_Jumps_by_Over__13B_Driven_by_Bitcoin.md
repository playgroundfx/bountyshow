A rally in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major
technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report
an increased interest from institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time
it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk.
The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around
$9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than
6.4% rise from the day before.

The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market
had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around
1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood
at $268.07 billion.

Industry participants said that a number of factors — from supportive
central bank monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to increased interest from institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s — has factored into the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rally.

Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a
low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the
price has rallied over 150%.

Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have
recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March
low.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented
measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus
outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European
Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central
bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.
