Bitcoin (BTC) price showed a bit of strength by briefly pushing to
$9,235 as the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close occurred but at the time of writing the top-
ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap is trading below the $9,200
resistance.

![BTC Bulls Pin Hopes on Descending Channel Breakout to $10K][1]

As discussed in the previous analysis by Cointelegraph Markets, the
price remains pinned below the 20-MA and the descending trendline from
the June 1 high at $10,380. Until Bitcoin can secure a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close above
the $10,400-$10,500 level the price remains at risk of a breakdown to
the $8,800 support.

The 1-hour chart shows todayâ€™s rejection occurred slightly above the
$9,200 resistance and descending trendline where the price formed a
tweezer top before pulling back to $9,165. On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, the
RSI remains below 50 but on the MACD the histogram has flipped from red
to pink as the bars begin to shorten and the Bitcoin price is forming
higher lows, signaling that selling has begun to decrease. The MACD has
also started to flatten and pull closer to the signal line.

Currently, Bitcoin is below the descending channel trendline and 20-MA
but if bulls can manage a high volume spike the price could surge above
the high volume VPVR node at $9,600 and in the process flip the
$9,200-$9,500 area to support. Failure to turn $9,400 to support in the
short-term is likely to result in a revisit to the $8,900 support where
buyers continue to show interest in purchasing.

Traders looking to go long might wait for a bounce at $8,900 or even a
breakdown of this key support level. Meanwhile, bears will likely look
to open short positions from $9,400 through $9,600 as the price has seen
in this zone. As the Bitcoin price traded sideways, altcoins moved
slightly higher. Crypto.com Coin (CRO) rallied 6.62% while Cosmos (ATOM)
and Enjin Coin (ENJ) gained 4.20% and 12.23%, respectively.
