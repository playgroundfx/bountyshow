After an impressive run to a new all-time high on Dec.1, Bitcoin (BTC)
price appears to have entered a short consolidation phase as the price
ranges between $18,200 and $19,500. The 1 and 4-hour charts show the
price compressing into a pennant-like structure and break out from the
pattern would likely see the price move to the $19,400 level where is a
bit more resistance.

A breakthrough the pennant would also suggest that the $19,000 level
could now function as solid support and if bulls are able to flip the
$19,400 to $19,500 zone to support then an attempt at overtaking the new
all-time high is expected. As many analysts have pointed out, periods of
consolidation and pullbacks to retest underlying support are critically
important to sustaining the strength of an uptrend.

Furthermore, if Bitcoin is truly is in a bull market, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will
view major and minor pullbacks as purchasing opportunities. Clear
evidence of this can be seen in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart which shows traders
buying into every significant dip since mid-October. We can also see
that the pattern of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) higher lows is intact even after the most
recent strong rejections at the $19,000 level.

If Bitcoin price fails to push through $19,200 or loses the $19,000
level, the volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows thereâ€™s support at
$18,650 and below this at $17,800. $17,800 is also aligned with the
20-day moving average, a metric that has been respected since the
uptrend first began on Oct. 7 when Bitcoin price traded for $10,600.
