The recent [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) surge continues. According to Coindesk, the
cryptocurrency, which fell to $8,000 in May, exceeded $9,000 for the
first time since May 2018 on Monday.

The cost of the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached the level
of $9,455.05 according to Monday, while on Tuesday the main
cryptocurrencies went down:

  * Bitcoin eased by 0.84 percent, to $9,208.89;

  * Ethereum fell by 1.16 percent to $269.83;

  * Bitcoin Cash lost 2.36 percent, reaching $421.50 at 9.40 GMT;

  * Litecoin reduced its value by 1.40 percent, to $132.03;

  * Ripple went down by 3.04 percent, to $0.4421.

The latter type of cryptocurrency added almost 8 percent yesterday due
to the information that MoneyGram intend to sign an agreement to use XPR
and the x-Rapid platform developed for cross-border transfers.

Ripple (XRP) is a global monetary system that appeared in 2012 for
inter-currency and gross payments. And now this type of cryptocurrency
will be used by the second largest company providing money transfer
services MoneyGram.

The deal will be continued for 2 years and Ripple will invest $50
million in MoneyGram.

Due to the fact that there was information that Facebook is preparing to
announce its cryptocurrency GlobalCoin, it is expected that the number
of remittances will decrease, which means that the Ripple-MoneyGram
partnership may be very far-sighted.
