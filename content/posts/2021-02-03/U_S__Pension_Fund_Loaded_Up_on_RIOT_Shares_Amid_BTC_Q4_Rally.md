California’s $441 billion public pension fund increased its stake in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) nearly sevenfold in last year’s Q4
amid the meteoric run-up in the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Rally][1]

California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) held 113,034
shares in RIOT worth over $1.9 million at the end of 2020, according to
Tuesday filings. That’s up from Q3 2020, when CalPERS’ 16,907 RIOT
shares were worth a comparatively minuscule $49,000.

The largest public pension fund in the U.S. had been holding firm on its
nearly 17 thousand RIOT shares since acquiring them during the bull run
in late 2017. That position seldom varied until now.

RIOT spiked 541% during Q4 2020. Meanwhile, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 6.15%) was up
174% for the quarter.
