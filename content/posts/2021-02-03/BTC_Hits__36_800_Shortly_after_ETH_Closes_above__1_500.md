Prominent business personalities like Elon Musk, Michael Saylor and Mark
Cuban continued to engage the public with discussions revolving around
the benefits of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology and decentralized finance. In
remarks to the reddit group r/Wallstreetbets, Cuban said that “stocks
will be on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) in the future.”

Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has now been integrated with the Stellar
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), enabling the stablecoin to be transacted on the Stellar
network and possibly take some of the strain of the clogged Ethereum
network.

Data from Glassnode shows USDC transaction volume on Ethereum has
steadily been increasing over the past year as the Coinbase backed coin
steadily gains ground on Tether (USDT). Utilizing Stellar [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
will greatly reduce USDC transaction fees and free up space on the
Ethereum network.
