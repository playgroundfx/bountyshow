Ethereum’s gas fees are again spiking to record highs, rendering many
decentralized finance protocols unusable for casual [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. After
increasing roughly 20% in the last 24 hours, average Ethereum
transaction fees are now sitting at a record $17.67. With many DeFi
projects requiring the execution of complex [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s, there are
reports fees associated with using protocols requiring complicated
transactions now exceed $1,000. Amid the chaos, Twitter-user “Olive
Allen” reported estimated gas fees of nearly $5,000 to accept a bid on
Rarible.

When Cointelegraph checked earlier today a single large transaction on
Synthetix was estimated at above $1,100 – however the protocol is
undergoing an upgrade which could affect estimates. But even simple
swaps using decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap cost from $40
to $75.

Responding to the high fees, ConsensusRough podcast co-host ‘Checkmate’
warned DeFi users to consider the expense involved in executing smart
contracts before investing. He shared the screenshot of a user that
purports to show estimated gas fees exceeding the price of Ether. (While
this could have been faked, it’s broadly in line with similar reports).

Ethereum is not alone in suffering congestion, with Bitcoin’s average
fees currently exceeding $14 too. Despite the skyrocketing costs
associated with utilizing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, traders
appear vehemently bullish with Ether posting a new all-time of $1,700 at
roughly 2 am UTC

Since breaking into new price highs on Feb. 2, Ether has gained roughly
14%. Bitcoin is also rallying, testing $38,000 after gaining 6% in the
last 24 hours. Ether’s record fees are highlighting the utility of
second-layer scaling solutions ahead of Ethereum’s Eth2’s overhaul.
Synthentix is currently in a staged migration to Optimistic roll ups to
alleviate gas prices, while other platforms are exploring rival layer-
two solutions such as xDai, or scalable layer-one networks such as
Polkadot.
