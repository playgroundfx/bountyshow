After a bloody week for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects that saw
numerous tokens plummet by up to 50%, the DeFi sector has rebounded by
19% in one day. Ether is also up 11% over the past 24 hours. According
to Messari, 32 of 37 DeFi tokens are up today, posting gains of between
3% and 39.6%.

Swerve (SWRV) tops the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts, followed by Yearn Finance (YFI)
with a 37.6% gain, Loopring (LRC) with 29.9%, Aave (LEND) with 29.4%,
and SushiSwap (SUSHI) with 27.8%. YFI’s rally comes despite its highly
anticipated Ether (ETH) vault producing a diminishing annual percentage
yield (APY) since launching roughly one week ago. However, the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
returns generated by Yearn Finance’s stablecoin vaults have pushed above
0.1%, likely fuelling the rally.

DeFi tokens have outperformed the broader Ethereum ecosystem, with 136
of 178 ETH-based tokens in the green for an average gain of 8.3%.
Ampleforth (AMPL) tops the [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) with an 84.5% gain, followed by YFI
and LRC.
