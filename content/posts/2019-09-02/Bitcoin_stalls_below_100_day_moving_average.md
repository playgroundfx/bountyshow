The technical analysis prove no signs of a digital currency easing in
bearish selling sentiment, in particular not for the next several days.

The one of the most famous digital currency halted its move below the
100-day moving average after short-term increase over weekend, thus
bringing a soft hope for a shift into a bearish trend.

This move could mean, that a balance between purchaser and sellers had
all chances to appear amid rope pulling in a range of $9,300 and $9,900.

The longer Bitcoin keeps the resistance level the higher the chance for
the next major sell-off as its value continue to be discovered.

Bullish trend will receive the support if during this month a rally
follows, or the Bitcoin’s price rises above $10.800.
