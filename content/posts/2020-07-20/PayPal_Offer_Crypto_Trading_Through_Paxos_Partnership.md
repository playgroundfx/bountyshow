Digital payments giant PayPal reportedly plans to facilitate
cryptocurrency trading through a new partnership with stablecoin
operator Paxos. Industry [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) outlet Coindesk reported on July 20 that
PayPal plans to introduce crypto trading through Paxos’ new brokerage
service. As of press time, it is unclear which crypto assets will be
supported by PayPal.

The report follows the July 15 announcement of Paxos’ launch of a crypto
brokerage that enables other firms to integrate crypto trading
functionalities. The service can be used through a simple application
programming interface integration and also manages regulatory
compliance. According to Coindesk, PayPal will use this new service to
deliver its crypto trading features.

The entrance of PayPal into the digital currencies space would signal a
major development for the cryptocurrency industry. The payments giant
was previously a member of the Libra Association — the governing council
for Facebook’s proposed stablecoin. However, following a wave of
skepticism from the public and regulators alike, PayPal withdrew from
the body in October 2019.
