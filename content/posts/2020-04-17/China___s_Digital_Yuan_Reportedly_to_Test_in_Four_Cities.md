Screenshots of a purported pilot version of a wallet app for China’s
forthcoming digital yuan are circulating on social media. Ling Zhang,
executive director of M&A, Global Fiat, at [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)
Binance first shared the images on April 14, later retweeted by the
exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao.

According to Ling Zhang, the app is available for download in four
cities selected for the initial trial — Shenzhen, Chengdu, Suzhou and
Xiongan. She highlights the inclusion of Xiongan, a new metropolis
located on the outskirts of Beijing, which has been the site of a so-
dubbed “smart city brain project.” The Xiongan New Area will have
enhanced intelligent infrastructure that spans satellite information
services, sensor recognition, a 5G network, supercomputing and big data
facilities. The city has already attracted the country’s tech giants
Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com and Baidu, with President Xi Jinping visiting
on more than one occasion.

Commenting on the screenshots, CZ remarked on China’s apparent
“execution speed” in rolling out its trial for the central bank digital
currency. As recently reported, China appears to have been accelerating
the development of the digital yuan, notwithstanding the COVID-19
crisis. On March 24, the Bank of China was alleged to have completed the
development of the currency’s basic [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) and to have already moved
on to drafting laws for its implementation.
