Uniswap clocked the record figure just after midnight (UTC) Monday and
currently has $2.06 billion worth of crypto assets locked in, according
to crypto [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) DeFi Pulse. Testament to its neck-breaking
growth, there’s now more value just in Uniswap than there was in the
entire DeFi space on July 9.

![$2B Locked: Uniswap Now Bigger Than Entire DeFi Industry Just Two
Months Ago][1]

As of press time, there’s now more than $11 billion in total value
locked (TVL) in DeFi, with Uniswap making up approximately 18% of that.
Based on Ethereum, Uniswap utilizes an [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) market-making system
leveraging liquidity pools so users can exchange or “swap” between ether
(ETH) and any ERC-20 token.

Holders are incentivized to deposit tokens in these liquidity pools with
interest and a cut of the swap fee – the total balance in these pools
together make up Uniswap’s $2 billion TVL. Monday’s [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) shows just how
much Uniswap’s fortunes have changed in the past few weeks.

Back in early September, $830 million worth of vital liquidity moved to
rival protocol SushiSwap, leading to Uniswap’s TVL to plunge to just
$400 million by September 10.  
A week later, in order to coax users back, Uniswap launched its own
native UNI token and airdropped over $500 million to wallet addresses
who had been using the protocol since before September.

UNI token has led users to quickly snap back to Uniswap and its TVL was
approximately $1.8 billion just days after the token launched.
