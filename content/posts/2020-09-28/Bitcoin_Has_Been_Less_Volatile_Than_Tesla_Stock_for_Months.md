Tesla (TSLA) has been seeing bigger [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) percentage moves since the end
of June, according to 30-day realized volatility data. Further, the
volatility gulf between the two assets has been widening in recent
weeks. Bitcoin witnessed a below-1.25% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) move in 14 out of the last
27 days, according to data from TradingView – almost 52% of the time.

However, Tesla only achieved sub-1.25% moves 6% of the time over the
same period, data source Skew tweeted early Monday. “People always
assume [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is incredibly volatile, but it’s not more volatile than
many popular tech stocks,” Skew co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Goh told
CoinDesk.

Tesla has seen a month-to-date price decline of 18% – far worse than
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s 6% drop. Bitcoin’s 30-day [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) volatility, which
measures the price action realized in the past 30 days, has been
flatlined near 55% (annualized) since Sept. 3. Further, its 30-day
implied volatility – that is, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ expectations of how volatile
price will be over the next four weeks – has declined to 44%, the lowest
level in nearly two years.

In the past, big moves have been preceded by an implied volatility
reading of less than 50%. At press time, the cryptocurrency is currently
trading at $10,911, representing an over 2% gain on the day. The weekly
chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and
trend strength, has crossed bearish below zero. As such, the
cryptocurrency may face some chart-driven selling pressure in the short
term.
