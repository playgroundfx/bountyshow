For the few weeks Bitcoin (BTC) price has moved within a $850 range and
recently the price resumed the trend of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) higher lows. Despite this,
$11,000 remains a hurdle the price has struggled to overcome but one
positive is that altcoins are beginning to recover some of the hefty
losses of the past few weeks.

Perhaps now that CME Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) closed without any major disruption
and a new month is on the verge of beginning, Bitcoin price can make a
move higher and finally clear the $11K resistance. The weekly time frame
shows strong support from $10,000-$10,500 and as Cointelegraph
contributor Rakesh Upadhyay noted:

While $10,000 has held as a solid level of support since the price made
a double bottom at $9,800, a revisit to the high volume VPVR node at
$9,500 is possible if BTC breaks the pattern of higher lows by falling
below the ascending trendline to $10,100. This seems unlikely given that
bulls have defended the $10K level quite vigorously over the past two
weeks.

Ultimately, not much has changed and Bitcoin price simply continues to
slowly grind higher. In the event of a breakout with sustained
purchasing from bulls, Bitcoin price could push through the $11K
resistance to attempt a higher high above $11,400. As shown on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframe, on Sept. 3 Bitcoin price dropped 13.3% from $11,400 and the
high volume VPVR node at this level suggests it will now function as
resistance.

While Bitcoin price continues to consolidate, altcoins moved a tad bit
higher. At the time of writing Polkadot (DOT) has gained 4.99%, OMG
Network (OMG) is up 25.18%, and Maker (MKR) has added 6.09%. According
to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at
$343.7 billion and Bitcoinâ€™s dominance index is currently at 57.5%.
