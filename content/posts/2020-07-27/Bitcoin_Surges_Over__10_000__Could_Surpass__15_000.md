Bitcoin prices were taking flight on Monday, pushing the digital
currency to the highest level in about two months and ending the long
dormancy of the world’s No. 1 virtual asset.

Bitcoin, the largest and most influential cryptocurrency, shot past the
key $10,000 resistance marker—all eyes are now on the critical $10,500
level,” wrote Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group,
a financial firm, advising some $12 billion.

Bitcoin’s recent rally to $10,237 took it to around its highest level
since June 1 based on spot prices.

Bitcoin futures trading on CME Group were at $10,335, the highest since
June 2, according to FactSet.

The move for the digital currency comes as gold prices have surged, amid
a rush for assets that considered alternatives to cash and stocks fueled
by the COVID-19 pandemic that has driven much of the developed world
into a deep recession.

Gold prices rallied to an intraday peak at $1.941.90, up more than 2%,
and taking out an intraday record for the most-active intraday at
$1,923.70 an ounce that had stood since an ounce from Sept. 6, 2011.

Prices for gold and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) have climbed as a gauge of the U.S. dollar
hit its weakest level since 2018. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was trading
down 0.7% at 93.736

As gold prices have neared a round-number record at $2,000, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has
seen mostly listless trade even as concerns about the virus and outsize
spending by governments to help prop up economies battered by pandemic
have supported bullion prices.

Some digital-currency bulls believe that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is starting to benefit
from some of the same dynamics that have lifted gold but in delay.

> “Bitcoin is currently realizing its reputation as a form of digital
gold. Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset,
but Bitcoin—which shares its key characteristics of being a store of
value and scarcity—could potentially knock gold from its long-held
position in the future as the world becomes evermore tech-driven,” Green
said.

Some experts believe that the growth in so-called stablecoins, which
tend to be pegged to a fiat currency or other asset like the U.S. dollar
or the euro EURUSD, 1.02%.

> “Well, one possible reason [for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s gains] is the rising
stablecoin market cap, wrote Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst at eToro,
in a Monday research note. “For example, Tether (USDT) crossed the $10
billion mark this month and USD Coin (USDC), Circle’s stablecoin, is
also at its highest level, having reached a market cap of over $1
billion. Perhaps some of this liquidity has made its way into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),”
speculated Peters, referring to the popular stablecoins Tether and USD
Coin, which is managed by a consortium of companies, including Coinbase
Inc. and Circle Internet Financial Ltd.

Stablecoins, which usually trade at a 1-to-1 ratio to the underlying
asset, have become popular because they can smooth out the volatility
typically associated with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and can make virtual assets more
compelling as digital currencies.

Bitcoin’s brief breakout to above $10,000 in June didn’t amount to much,
but some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now betting that the asset go touch $15,000 and
beyond.

> “The Bitcoin price crossed above the 10K mark and the price action
looks bullish now as the price has cleared a major psychological level
that has been there for a long time,” said Naeem Aslam, analyst at
AvaTrade, in a research note.

>

> “If the Bitcoin price does pick up the momentum, nothing else will be
able to match it as Bitcoin is a different kind of beast. We believe,
the next resistance for the Bitcoin price is 15K now,” he said.
