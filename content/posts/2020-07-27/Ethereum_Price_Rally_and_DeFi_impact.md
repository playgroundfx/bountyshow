On Saturday Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) price perked up as BTC briefly
pushed above $9,700 and Ether set a 2020 high at $309. The weekend surge
comes as a bit of a surprise as weekends are typically marked by low
trading volume and some traders avoid the markets due to the volatility
that sometimes accompanies the weekly close.

Technicals aside, Ether’s rapid ascent to $309 could also be receiving a
sentiment boost from the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the total value of funds locked into
decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) reached $4 billion today.
Currently, the top three DeFi platforms are Maker Aave, and Compound
with each having $875 million, $639 million and $616 million locked into
an assortment of contracts.

Data from DeFi Pulse shows that the decentralized finance sector has
grown tremendously in 2020 as the value locked at the start of the year
was slightly below $1 billion. As discussed in a previous market update,
Ether’s was expected to push toward the $317 level if the Feb. 14, 2020
high at $288.32 was cleared and Saturday’s rally to $309 fell just $8
short of topping the resistance cluster extending to $317. After a
nearly 30% rally this week, a period of consolidation is to be expected
but if bulls find renewed or Bitcoin rallies into the weekly close,
there is a possibility that the price could clear $317 and the absence
of overhead resistance could see bulls target the 2019 high at $367.

As Bitcoin and Ether pushed higher, a number of altcoins also made
significant moves. Cardano (ADA) surprised [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with a strong 21%
upside move to $0.1457, Binance Coin (BNB) also continued to rally with
a 5% gain. Litecoin (LTC) followed alongside Bitcoin with a 12.88% move
to $49.47.
