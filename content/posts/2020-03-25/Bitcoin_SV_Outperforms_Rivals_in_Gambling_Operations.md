Gambling companies and online casinos are drawing their attention to
cryptocurrencies as a possible payment tool. According to the recent
nChain studies, Bitcoin SV has become the most popular payment tool in
gambling.

The higher mentioned research was considering 14 most common and
publicly accessible [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s, across 23 different areas, including
Ethereum, Bitcoin and BSV as well as several private private [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s
such as Hyperledger. The BSV turned to be the only [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) to embrace
limitless chain scaling, managing to process 1000-6400 transactions per
second with an ability of reachment up to 4 million tps.

The ability to manage transaction volume, according to report, has vast
benefits. With large transaction volumes, there is no risk of sudden
network congestion slowing them down.

Other [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s can hardly provide the same capability, as Ethereum’s
18kb block capacity currently offers 15tps, whereas BTC’s 1MB cap limits
their tps to 7.

As for the cryptocurrencies rates on Wednesday, they are as follows:

  * Bitcoin lost 2.53 percent, trading at 6,580.36 at 1416 GMT;

  * Bitcoin SV lost 2.96 percent, to $170,63;

  * Ethereum lost 3.45 percent, to 135,31;

  * Ripple Eased by 1.86 percent, to 0,1596;

  * Bitcoin Cash dipped by 3.53 percent, to 218,80;

  * Litecoin tumbled by 3.27 percent, to 39,00.
