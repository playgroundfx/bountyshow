Cryptocurrency ether hit a record high on Wednesday, taking gains this
year to almost 500 per cent on the back of a growing interest in
decentralised finance applications and increasing institutional interest
in cryptocurrencies.

Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), climbed to $4,372.35, eclipsing its previous record hit on
Monday, and was last up 2 per cent. Bitcoin was down a touch at $56,240.

Ether has jumped almost 500 per cent against the dollar this year as the
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) becomes more widely used by peer-to-peer – or
decentralised – cryptocurrency platforms that enable crypto-denominated
lending outside of traditional banking institutions.

The surge has also seen ether – which in the crypto world is also widely
referred to as [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) – outperform [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which has almost doubled
in price this year as larger [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s warm to the emerging technology.

US bank J.P. Morgan on Wednesday said the pace of evolution in the
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) market has “remained rapid” and that there was still room for
growth.

Open interest in CME Ethereum futures had increased to $540 million in
three months, the bank’s analysts said in a note. A similar level of
open interest in CME Bitcoin futures took more than two years after
listing in 2017, they added.

> “Effectively, once Bitcoin futures became more accepted among
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, they became more comfortable with
cryptocurrencies paving the way for a more rapid acceptance of [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/)
futures,” J.P. Morgan said.

Still, U.S. regulators warned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on Tuesday over the risks of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures in [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) investments. In a statement, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was a highly speculative
market that lacked [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/).

The same J.P. Morgan analysts warned last week that ether’s increasing
valuation was not underpinned by data showing how widely it is used.

Factors such as the number of active digital addresses in its network
would be more consistent with a price of around $1,000, the US bank
said.
