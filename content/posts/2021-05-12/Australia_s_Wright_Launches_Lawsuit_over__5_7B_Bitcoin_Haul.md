An Australian computer scientist who alleges he created [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has
launched a London High Court lawsuit against 16 software developers in
an effort to secure [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) worth around 4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion)
he says he owns.

In a case that was promptly labelled “bogus” by one defendant, Craig
Wright is demanding that developers allow him to retrieve around 111,000
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) held at two digital addresses that he does not have private keys
for.

In his second London lawsuit in three weeks, Wright alleges he lost the
encrypted keys when his home computer network was hacked in February
2020. Police are investigating.

Wright, who is bringing the case through his Seychelles-based Tulip
Trading firm, concedes he is a controversial figure since alleging in
2016 that he wrote the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) white paper - which first outlined the
technology behind the digital assets - under the pseudonym Satoshi
Nakamoto in 2008.

The claim is hotly disputed.

The Australian, who is autistic and lives in Britain with his wife and
two of his three children, alleges in his latest lawsuit that developers
have breached their duties to act in the best interests of the rightful
owner of globally-traded assets.

> “Our client has always maintained that he created [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to operate
within existing laws and that in the event of loss or theft, where
legitimate ownership can be proven, the developers have a duty to ensure
recovery,” said Paul Ferguson, a partner at law firm Ontier, which is
representing Wright.

The case is being brought against the developers of four networks -
Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and
Bitcoin Cash ABC (ABC) - at addresses in continental Europe, the United
States, New Zealand, Australia and Japan, a court filing seen by Reuters
showed.

One of the defendants, Peter Todd, said he and others were not involved
in day-to-day network development, that Wright had not proven his
ownership and that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) should not be subject to “arbitrary seizure”.

> “As this very case shows, if we allow people to get coins seized and
reassigned by court order, that puts your coins at risk of being stolen
by abuses of those fallible processes,” he said by email.

Other defendants were not immediately available.

Bitcoin, which surged to hit a record of almost $65,000 in April, was
trading at $56,749 on Wednesday afternoon.
