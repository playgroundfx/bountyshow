MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s central bank is informally urging lenders to
cut ties with [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s and traders as the highly
speculative market booms, despite a Supreme Court ruling that banks can
work with the industry, three sources told Reuters

The guidance comes as India is crafting a law to ban cryptocurrencies
and penalize anyone dealing in them, which would be among the most
sweeping crackdowns on the new investing fad in the world. But with the
COVID-19 crisis engulfing the country, no one is sure when such a bill
may be passed, adding to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ confusion.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2018 had forbidden banks from dealing
in all transactions related to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other such assets. That
diktat was challenged by the crypto exchanges and in March 2020, India’s
top court overturned the RBI ban and allowed lenders to extend banking
facilities to them.

With [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continuing to rush into the hot new asset class, however,
regulators appear to be gearing up for another try.

Thousands of new users are piling into the system every day at a time
when the prices of major digital currencies have been on the rise. There
are over 10 million crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in India with total holdings of
over 100 billion rupees ($1.36 billion), according to industry
estimates. No official data is available.

> “The regulator has been unofficially asking us that why are we dealing
in such business when it is ultra speculative. A lot of money flows
overseas via this trade which the RBI is not comfortable with as it may
lead to money laundering,” said a senior executive at one of the banks
which was [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)ed.

RBI did not respond to a request for comment.

Private lender ICICI Bank has already asked payment service companies
that it works with to stop all crypto-related payment transactions,
three sources said, while other lenders are also following suit.

ICICI Bank did not respond to an email seeking comment.

None of the sources wanted to be identified as the discussions with RBI
were private and no official order has been issued yet.

> “Even though the discussions are informal that is enough. No one wants
to go against the regulator,” said another source.

The central bank has often voiced its apprehension about digital
currencies. Earlier this year, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that
they have “major concerns (around crypto) from the financial stability
angle.”.

## THE CRYPTO CONUNDRUM

With Indian banks increasingly wary of dealing with them, crypto
exchanges are scrambling to find new business partners.

Axis Bank, Citibank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and others are limiting their
exposure to the cryptocurrency market, sources said.

> “Axis Bank has taken a fairly negative stance against crypto. They are
citing internal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and risk measures and have stopped transactions
with crypto exchanges,” said the CEO of a global crypto exchange with
presence in India.

IndusInd Bank is also in the process of stopping all crypto-related
transasaction, said two sources.

Axis, Kotak and IndusInd did not reply to an email seeking comment while
Citibank declined to comment.
