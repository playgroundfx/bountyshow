Bitcoin regained some of the losses sustained after Elon Musk said that
Tesla would stop accepting the digital tokens as payment for its cars,
and was trading at nearly $50,000 on Thursday.

The price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped 17% from around
$54,819 to $45,700, its lowest since March 1, in just under two hours
following Musk’s tweet on Wednesday.

Bitcoin later recovered about half of that drop and was trading at
around $49,265 at 1119 GMT, while Ether, the second-largest
cryptocurrency, which had dropped 14% to a low of $3,550, rose above
$4,000 before dipping back to around $3,700.

An announcement by Tesla on Feb. 8 that it had bought $1.5 billion of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and that it would accept it as payment for its electric vehicles
has been one factor behind the digital token’s surging price this year.

But Tesla Chief Executive Musk has faced pressure about the
environmental impact of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) since the announcement.

> “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for
Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst
emissions of any fuel,” Musk tweeted.

Musk’s comments roiled markets even though he said Tesla would not sell
any [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and would resume accepting it as soon as “mining” for it
transitioned to more sustainable energy.

The digital currency is still trading about 30% higher than it was
before Tesla’s announcement.

Jeffrey Wang, Vancouver-based head of Americas at Amber Group, a
cryptocurrency service provider, said broader selling of risk assets in
traditional markets was another factor behind Wednesday’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
plunge.

> “I don’t think everything is selling off just because of this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).
This was kind of the straw that broke the camel’s back in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
adding to the risk sell-off,” Wang said.

The S&P 500 dropped 2.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7% on
Wednesday. [.N]

Bitcoin has struggled since hitting a record $64,895.22 in mid-April,
dropping to the cusp of $47,000 just 11 days later before hovering
around $58,000 since the start of May.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

At current rates, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining devours about the same amount of energy
annually as the Netherlands did in 2019, data from the University of
Cambridge and the International Energy Agency showed.

> “Environmental matters are an incredibly sensitive subject right now,
and Tesla’s move might serve as a wake-up call to businesses and
consumers using Bitcoin, who hadn’t hitherto considered its carbon
footprint,” Laith Khalaf, an analyst at AJ Bell, said.

Tesla shares were down 1% in pre-market trading. The biggest U.S.
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/), Coinbase, was down 5%. Smaller cryptocurrencies
were less affected by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

> “Interestingly enough, altcoins are performing well,” said Justin
d’Anethan, sales manager at Hong Kong-based head of exchange sales at
Diginex, a digital asset company.

>

> “The reason given in the tweet is fossil fuel use for the mining of
BTC, but most cryptocurrencies have already found more efficient ways to
do that and therefore outperformed.”

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dominance index, a ratio of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s share of the total
market cap of all cryptocurrencies, dropped to 42%, its lowest since
June 2018.

Makoto Sakuma, a researcher at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo said,
“The issue (of huge energy use by [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miners) has been long known so
it’s nothing new, but taken together with Musk’s recent comments about
dogecoin, his latest comments seems to suggest his passion for
cryptocurrencies may be waning.”

Cryptocurrency dogecoin lost more than a third of its price on Sunday
after Musk, whose tweets had stoked demand for the token earlier this
year, called it a “hustle” on the “Saturday Night Live” comedy show.

By Tuesday, however, he was asking his followers on Twitter if they
wanted Tesla to accept dogecoin.
