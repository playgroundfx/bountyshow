The cryptocurrency market came under impressive pressure on Monday
afternoon, taking 6% off its total capitalisation to 2.12 trillion. The
Fear and Greed Index for the sector returned to the extreme fear
territory, dropping from 28 to 21.

It is not easy to pinpoint the new wave of pressure trigger, but it
intensified and widened after the two largest cryptocurrencies gave up
their key positions.

Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day average, trading below $47K at the
time of writing. Excluding the intraday drop on the 6th of December,
these are the lowest values since early October, and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has lost a
third of its value from its peak levels just over a month ago. By and
large, the highs at 69k were the starting point for pressure on the
BTCUSD. Should the decline develop, it is worth paying increased
attention to the 40k and 30k levels, significant round levels where
Bitcoin had previously turned to the upside.

The ETHUSD decline below 4,000 has intensified the sell-off. The
pullback now exceeds 23% of the peak, signalling the start of a bear
market. ETHUSD’s previous deep correction earlier this year only halted
after a 60% loss, taking the price back from $4400 to the $1700 area.
Should upward pressure develop, the intensity of the tug-of-war between
bulls and bears could increase near the $3300, $2700, and $1800 levels,
which acted as turning points earlier this year.

The whole crypto sphere is in a Bear market. Their total capitalisation
is already more than 30% lower from their peaks, and attempts to
consolidate beyond critical levels have failed. Last summer,
cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest returned after capitalisation fell by
more than half. This suggests the potential for a further 30% decline
from current levels.
