FRANKFURT, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Germany's savings banks, a conservative
bastion that holds more than 1 trillion euros for thrifty Germans, is
looking into offering a wallet to trade cryptocurrency, a group of the
banks said on Monday.

The project marks a potentially radical departure for the banks, whose
customers still use cash and eschew risky investing or heavy borrowing.

Entrusted with the savings and investments of roughly 50 million
customers, they make up Germany's biggest financial group.

> "The interest in crypto assets is huge," a spokesman for the German
Savings Banks Association said, with reference to the pilot project. He
said no decision had been taken and that the savings banks group was
currently sceptical.

German magazine Capital first reported the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

The move comes against a backdrop of high inflation and penalty charges
on banks and savers from negative interest rates, fuelling a heated
debate in Germany about central bank money printing.

It has prompted Germans to invest more in property and elsewhere to
avoid what some have dubbed the "expropriation" of their wealth.

Last month, Helmut Schleweis, the president of the German Savings Bank
Association, called the combination of low interest rates and rising
prices a "toxic mix," saying it had become harder to stop the erosion of
wealth.

Bitcoin , the world's largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of
roughly $1.2 trillion, has risen strongly, fuelled in part by fears of
inflation, with its limited supply seen as offering protection.

Bitcoin also has dozens of smaller rivals, all vying for a share of the
wider $2 trillion digital currency market.

Among the major "altcoins" - as all cryptocurrencies aside from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
are known - some, such as [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/), aspire to be the backbone of a
future financial system. Others, like Dogecoin, are barely used in
payments.

Retail punters are pouring money into them, despite their volatile track
record, in hopes of a quick profit.
