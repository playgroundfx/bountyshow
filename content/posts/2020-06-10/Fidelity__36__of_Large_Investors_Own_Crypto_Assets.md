Bitcoin has been on a tear this year as markets whipsawed amid the
coronavirus pandemic and reopening efforts. The digital currency has
gained 36% for the year after tumbling in early March and swiftly
recovering.

Fidelity’s survey found that the biggest obstacles cited by firms still
hesitant to dive into crypto were price volatility and concerns about
market manipulation.

The survey was executed by Greenwich Associates between November and
March, right before the crypto market sank and recovered.
