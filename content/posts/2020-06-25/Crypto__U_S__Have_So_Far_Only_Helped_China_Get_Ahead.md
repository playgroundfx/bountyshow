Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen discussed U.S. regulators’ ignorance
towards regulating the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and crypto space and how it is helping
China.

In a recent interview with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna,
Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen said that the
United States has been “slow to the game” in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of experimenting,
implementing and regulating the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and cryptocurrency industry.

Larsen said that the U.S. must change its viewpoint toward [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
and cryptocurrency, as the industry is already past the 2017 and 2018
hype. The war against initial coin offering scams is won, he said, and
now regulators must address the industry so that they can compete with
China’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and cryptocurrency progress.

According to Larsen, U.S. regulators have so far only helped China get
ahead by “officially giving clarity to the two protocols effectively
controlled by Chinese miners: Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

If regulators fail to provide more clarity on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/),
cryptocurrencies and the supporting technologies that will power the
next-generation global financial system, the U.S. could face a potential
catastrophe, Larsen warned.
