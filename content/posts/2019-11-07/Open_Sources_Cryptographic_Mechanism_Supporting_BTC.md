The world's leading [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) platform Binance disclosed
recently its code, which was meant for providing cryptocurrency
operations security.

Binance crypto exchange launched cryptographic mechanism of open-sourced
nature that can be implemented in Bitcoin and Ethereum dealings. It was
entitled as the Threshold Signature Scheme

or TSS [Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ry. The mechanism is already implemented on Binance Chain.

> So, providers of wallet as well as custodians can now “avoid single
points of failure in private keys with distributed key management,” as
it has been revealed by Binance representative. Personal keys are
substantially passwords, which provide the cryptocurrency operations
security for users to be sure about their money safeness.

TSS tool uses distributed computing system to pitch in and approve a
transaction by means of initiation each part of the private key
separately.

This tool has some similar features with a tech that already is used, a
widely-known one as multi-sig instrument. However, there is also the
fundamental distinction with Binance’s product is that the activity can
be done off the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) tech, thus saving time and cost.

This type of signature has been audited by relevant authorities. One has
doubts still that all this will steer clear the crypto industry from the
untold hacks and data leakage.
