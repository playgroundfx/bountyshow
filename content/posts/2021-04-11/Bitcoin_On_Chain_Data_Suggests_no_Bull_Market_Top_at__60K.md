For the very first time in a Bitcoin (BTC) bull market, not only long-
term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s but also short-term speculators who usually add to the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) sell pressure toward the end of a market cycle have become
increasingly confident of higher prices as they hold on to their
Bitcoin. This only adds to the already existing supply shock. If demand
remains strong, this is a recipe for another leg up for the BTC price.

Every Bitcoin bull market usually coincided with an increasing number of
short-term speculators coming into the market hoping to turn a quick
profit, while long-term speculators start to add sell pressure toward
the second half of the market cycle to realize their profits. One of the
best on-chain indicators to see this trend unfold in each cycle is
called HODL waves. Hereby, the length at which each BTC address holds
Bitcoin before they are sold into the market is clustered into term
buckets that are then visualized in different color bands.

For example, someone who held on to their Bitcoin for five months would
fall into the 3m-6m bucket, the light orange color band. If that person
decides to sell, it falls out of that bucket and would show up in the
24h-term bucket, the dark red color band. This means, the redder the
colors are in the HODL waves chart on a respective date, the more short-
term turnover of Bitcoins happens. This activity is almost at its lowest
during a bear market, and at its highest during a bull market, while the
short-term activity tends to peak around a bull market top.

activity declining][2]

Bitcoin selling activity whether it is from speculators or long-term
holders is declining while also the annual spending behavior relative to
the market capitalization is surprisingly low. All these on-chain data
points suggest that the market is inching to an even deeper supply
squeeze. This is one of the best rocket fuels to send the Bitcoin price
higher.

However, this is not a guarantee as it requires continuous demand for
the price to appreciate in this environment. Therefore, a close eye on
high-net-worth individuals and institutionsâ€™ demand should be kept, as
they have recently been the main driver on the buyer side.
