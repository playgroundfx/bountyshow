2021 has been an impressive year for Binance Coin (BNB), which so far
has rallied by more than 900%. One of the primary drivers of BNB’s
growth was continued congestion on the Ethereum network. As this
struggle carried on, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) emerged as an
alternative, meeting the rapidly growing decentralized finance (DeFi)
sector’s demands. As BNB reached a $64 billion market capitalization, it
has surpassed traditional banks, including Santander, the Bank of
Montreal, and UBS. Meanwhile, some analysts point to the estimated value
and impact of Coinbase’s upcoming direct listing ($100-billion
valuation) as a catalyst for the BNB price hike.

A common narrative spun up over the past few weeks is that the direct
listing of COIN is also adding value to centralized exchange tokens.
Analysts are also speculating that other U.S.-based regulated exchanges
like Kraken and Gemini will likely follow Coinbase’s path and attempt to
raise funds through a stock offering.

BNB token provides holders with a discount on trading fees, and it is
required for those wishing to participate in Binance Launchpad token
sales. As BNB gained liquidity, it also became a base pair for other
cryptocurrencies at Binance exchange. Over time, other uses emerged as
the Binance Smart Chain gained traction. For example, BNB can cover
network fees and as serve as a utility token in the ecosystem, which
includes decentralized apps (dApps) and games.

Periodically Binance burns (destroys) some of the non-circulating BNB
tokens based on the exchange’s overall trading volume. This strategy’s
efficacy vanished over time as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s understood that these destroyed
tokens never entered the circulating supply. The Binance Smart Chain
network uses a Proof of Stake Authority which eliminates the need for
miners or expensive transaction fees. The platform kept its
compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and has a similar
token and [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) structure.

Many tokenized (or pegged) cryptocurrencies have gained relevance in
Binance’s networks, allowing users to bypass miner fees. Another benefit
provided by Binance Smart Chain’s BEP-20 model is staking and farming
capabilities in its vast network of decentralized applications,
including the PancakeSwap DEX and Venus lending platform.

If done correctly, BNB’s market capitalization could surpass that of the
entire traditional banking system, but before this can happen these
networks and decentralized applications need to gain adoption and prove
that they can stand up to the needs of mainstream [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and banking
clients.
