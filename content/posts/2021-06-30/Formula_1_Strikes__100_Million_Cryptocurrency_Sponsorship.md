![Formula 1 strikes $100 million cryptocurrency sponsorship][1]

Formula 1 landed a new sponsor Tuesday in a deal with Crypto.com, a
platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Terms of
the agreement were not provided, but people familiar with the pact told
CNBC it’s a five-year deal that totals over $100 million. In this
agreement, Crypto.com will get brand presence around F1 events,
including the new Sprint series, a qualifying format that determines
starting positions at races. In addition, Crypto.com will also receive
trackside slots at F1 races for the remainder of the season.

The company will also introduce a new award at F1′s Belgian Grand Prix
in August and become its NFT partner. The Crypto.com agreement activates
on July 17, a day before the 2021 British Grand Prix at the Silverstone
Circuit in England. In a statement, Ben Pincus, F1 director of
commercial partnerships, said the racing organization would use
“expertise” from Crypto.com “as we explore the world of cryptocurrency,
an area we are very interested in.”

Crypto.com says it has over 10 million users on its platform and has an
app available for Apple devices and Android phones. The company makes
revenue from transaction fees and has other sports partnerships,
including F1 team Aston Martin and National Hockey League franchise, the
Montreal Canadiens.
