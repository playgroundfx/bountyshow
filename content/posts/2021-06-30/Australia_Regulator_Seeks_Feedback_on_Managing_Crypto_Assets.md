June 30 (Reuters) - Australia’s securities regulator said on Wednesday
it would consult market participants on proposals to identify
appropriate crypto assets and set up good market practices for financial
instruments that expose them to digital currency-backed assets.

The move comes as governments and regulators worldwide try to regulate
the digital assets industry in the wake of rising [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) affinity for
cryptocurrencies, which are volatile and risky for users and financial
institutions.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has seen its price swing
wildly this year, trading over the $35,500 level on Wednesday after
hitting an all-time high of just under $65,000 in mid-April.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) sees a “real
risk of harm to consumers and markets” if exchange-traded products
(ETPs) and other instruments exposed to crypto-backed assets are not
developed and regulated properly.

The regulator is proposing to establish good practices with regard to
the pricing, ownership, risk management and disclosure of these
instruments to protect retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and maintain fair market
practices.

> “Market operators and product issuers need to be mindful of meeting
their existing regulatory obligations when creating, operating and
allowing such products,” ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said.

The proposals consider these assets as financial instruments under the
Australian corporations law, and hence they fall under the purview of
the ASIC for [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/).

The regulator will issue a feedback report and publish information on
good practices following consultation on the proposals, it said.
