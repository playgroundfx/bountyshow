![Bitcoin Gathers Upside [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html), Faces Resistance Near $40K][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) buyers remained active during Asian trading hours as they
defended initial support of about $33,800. The next level of resistance
is seen between $38,000 and $40,000, which is near the top of a
monthlong range. The $30,000 support level was retested over the
weekend, marking a higher low from the June 22 shakeout of around
$29,000. Price remains elevated and could break above the 100-period
moving average on the four-hour chart.

Bitcoin was trading at about $35,000 at press time and is up 4% over the
past 24 hours. Bitcoin is attempting to reverse a short-term downtrend,
which could yield further upside, especially since the relative strength
index (RSI) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart is not yet overbought. The corrective
phase since May appears to be slowing as buyers return at support
levels.
