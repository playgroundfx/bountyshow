Bitcoin (BTC) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) aggregate open interest has increased to $2
billion, which is 13% below the all-time high. Although the open
interest is still heavily concentrated on Deribit exchange, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) has also reached $300 million. In simple
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) derivatives contracts allow [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy protection,
either from the upside (call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)) or downside (put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)). Even
though there are some more complex strategies, the mere existence of
liquid [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) markets is a positive indicator.

For example, derivative contracts allow miners to stabilize their income
which is tied to a cryptocurrency’s price. Arbitrage and market-making
firms also utilize the instruments to hedge their trades. Ultimately,
deeply liquid markets attract larger participants and increase their
efficiency. Implied volatility is a useful and primary metric that can
be extracted from [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) pricing. Whenever traders perceive increased
risk of larger price oscillations, the indicator will shift higher. The
opposite occurs during periods when the price is flat or if there is
expectation of milder price swings.

Volatility is commonly known as a fear indicator, but this is mostly a
backward-looking metric. The 2019 spike coincided with the $13,880 peak
on June 26, followed by a sudden $1,400 decline. The more recent
volatility spike from March 2020 happened after a 50% decline occurred
in just 8 hours. Periods of low volatility are catalysts for more
substantial price movements as it signals that market makers and
[arbitrage](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/arbitrage-bot-bitcoin/) desks are willing to sell protection on lower premiums.

The current $4.2 billion in aggregate open interest might be modest
compared to the August peak at $5.7 billion, but is still relevant. A
couple of reasons might be holding back a larger figure, including the
current BitMEX CFTC charges and KuCoin’s $150 million hack. High
volatility is another critical factor holding back the open interest on
Bitcoin derivatives.

Despite 57% being the lowest figure in the past 16 months, it still
represents a sizable premium, especially for longer-term [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). Both
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and futures have a lot of synergy, as more advanced strategies
combine both markets. A buyer betting on a $14K strike for the March 21
expiry in 160 days must pay a 10% premium. Therefore, the price at
expiry must reach $15,165 or 34% above the current $11,300.

As a comparison, Apple shares hold a 41% 3-month volatility. Although
higher than the S&P 500’s 29%, the long-term impact versus Bitcoin’s 47%
has striking effects. The same 34% upside for a March 2021 call option
for AAPL shares has a 2.7% premium.

Betting on $20K? Options might not be the best way  
Although there is an implied cost to carrying a perpetual futures
position for more extended periods, it hasn’t been burdensome. This is
because the funding rate of perpetual futures is usually charged every 8
hours. The funding rate has been oscillating between positive and
negative for the past couple of months. This results in a net neutral
impact on buyers (longs) and short sellers that might have been carrying
open positions.

Due to its inherent high volatility, Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) might not be the
optimal way to structure leveraged bets. The same $1,150 cost of the
March 2021 option could be used to acquire Bitcoin futures using a 4x
leverage. This would yield a $1,570 gain (136%) once Bitcoin reaches the
same 34% upside required for the option break even.

The above example does not invalidate [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) use, especially when
building strategies that include selling call or put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). One should
keep in mind that [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) have a set expiry. Therefore if the desired
price range occurs only the following day, it yields no gain at all.

For the bulls out there, unless there is a specific price range and time
frame in mind, it seems for now sticking with perpetual futures is the
best solution.
