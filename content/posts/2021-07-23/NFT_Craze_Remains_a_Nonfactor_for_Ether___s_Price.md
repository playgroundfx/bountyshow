![NFT Craze Remains a Nonfactor for Ether’s Price][1]

Not everyone’s happy with the rapid growth of the non-fungible tokens
(NFTs), especially some people who are already inside the volatile
crypto market for a bit longer time, aka, the “crypto natives.” As NFTs
gain popularity despite an overall bearish sentiment in the crypto
market, some NFT critics inside the market took to Twitter blaming the
non-crypto natives who cash out their ether immediately after NFT sales
for the lackluster price movement of the second-largest cryptocurrency
by market capitalization.

But according to multiple analysts and market participants, the impact
of NFT sales, if any at all, remains a nonfactor on ether’s prices.
Instead, the complaint showcases many traders and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
frustrations in a dull market. The speculation “is more like a
reflection of the current market sentiment,” Daniel Lv, co-founder of
China-based [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) Nervos Network, told CoinDesk through a
representative.

The blame, though, isn’t completely irrational since growth in the NFT
market has not quite slowed down partly because of the large number of
endorsements it has received from non-crypto celebrities. The sort of
statement or action by non-crypto people like Mike Winkelmann, aka
Beeple, only further legitimated the blame: Beeple, who received his
record-breaking $53 million in ether (ETH) for selling his NFT through
Christie’s, told The New Yorker that he converted ether into fiat, which
was seen by the crypto industry as a “betrayal.”
