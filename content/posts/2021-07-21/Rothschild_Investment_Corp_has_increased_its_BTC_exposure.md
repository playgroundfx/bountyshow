![Rothschild Investment Corp has increased its Bitcoin exposure by 300%
since April][1]

Billion-dollar investment firm Rothschild Investment Corp quadrupled its
exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) since April, new records show. In a filing
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on
Saturday, Rothschild confirmed that it now owns 141,405 shares of the
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). A quiet but nonetheless substantial
player among institutions, Rothchild Investment Corp has also invested
in Grayscale’s Ether (ETH) equivalent, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.

Its exposure to Bitcoin has increased considerably this year, the filing
shows — in April, its GBTC shares totaled 38,346. In BTC [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), with
each GBTC share equal to 0.000939767 BTC, Rothschild thus has an
equivalent Bitcoin exposure of 132.8 BTC ($3.94 million). The data
implies that declining prices have not fazed executives, while Bitcoin
has been maintaining a drawdown for three months after hitting its all-
time highs of $64,500 in mid May.

As Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein noted this week, institutional
players are likely taking little notice of short-term price moves,
instead concentrating on a much lower-time-preference strategy when it
comes to cryptocurrency.
