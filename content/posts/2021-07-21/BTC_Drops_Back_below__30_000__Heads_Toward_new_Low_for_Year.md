![Bitcoin drops back below $30,000, heads toward new low for the
year][1]

The price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dropped below $30,000 late Monday night for the
first time since Jun. 22, dragging other digital coins lower with it.
Bitcoin is trading in the $29,000 range, about 3% lower on the day,
according to Coin Metrics. Ether is down 1.25% and XRP fell 4%. Even
with the plunge [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is up 2.3% for the year, according to CoinDesk
data. Ether and XRP are both up about 140% for the year.

The plunge in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) came after a big sell-off in global stock markets.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day since last
October. “There’s been a broad sell-off in global markets, risk assets
are down across the board,” Annabelle Huang, partner at cryptocurrency
financial services firm Amber Group, said.

There are “concerns of the quality and strength of economic recovery”
and “broader risk assets turned weaker including high yields,” Huang
said. “Coupled with recent BTC ([bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)) weakness, this just sent crypto
market down further.”

At one point early Tuesday, about $89 billion was wiped off the entire
cryptocurrency market in a 24-hour period. Since [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s all-time high
of nearly $65,000 in mid-April, its price has plunged over 50%. A
renewed crackdown in China on cryptocurrency trading and mining has
weighed on the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price.

Major regions responsible for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining in China have forced
operations to shut down. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process
that facilitates [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) transactions and creates new coins.
