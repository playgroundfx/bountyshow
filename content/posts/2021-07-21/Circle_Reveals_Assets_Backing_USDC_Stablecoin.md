![Circle Reveals Assets Backing USDC Stablecoin][1]

The majority of Circle’s USDC stablecoin is backed by U.S. dollars, the
company revealed on Tuesday. Circle, a global payments company, was one
of USDC’s creators. It published a breakdown of its assets backing the
stablecoin for the first time in its latest attestation report, which
was dated July 16. According to the report, about 61% of its tokens are
backed by “cash and cash equivalents,” meaning cash and money market
funds.

Yankee Certificates of Deposit – meaning CDs issued by foreign
(non-U.S.) banks – comprise a further 13%, U.S. Treasuries account for
12%, commercial paper accounts for 9%, and the remaining tokens are
backed by municipal and corporate bonds. The company has issued about
$22.2 billion worth of USDC, according to the attestation.

It’s unclear what, specifically, Circle has invested in to back USDC.
The company intends to go public later this year in a merger with a
special purpose acquisition company that would value Circle at $4.5
billion.
