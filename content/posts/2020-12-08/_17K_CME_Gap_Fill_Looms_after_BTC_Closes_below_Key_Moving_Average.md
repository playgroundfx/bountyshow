After spending the last few days trading in a tightening range, Bitcoin
(BTC) price dropped from its pennant structure and closed below the
20-day moving average ($18,600). Since topping out at $19,888 a number
of analysts cautioned that Bitcoin price was at risk of a strong
pullback if it failed to either secure a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close above $19,500 or at
least hold $19,000 as support.

During Bitcoin’s most recent bull phases the price has held above the
20-MA so a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close below this metric could be a signal that a short-
term trend change is in order. In this instance, it also appears that
bulls are yet to purchase the current dip. As the price dropped and the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close approached crypto analyst Alex Saunders said, “Unless
$18,700 holds, the descending triangle likely takes us lower short
term.”

On the other hand, Cointelegraph analyst Micheal van de Poppe tweeted
that despite the drop Bitcoin price is: “Still in the range, but the
more often support gets tested, the weaker it becomes. Volatility will
likely occur between $18,500 and $19,500.”  
Van de Poppe further explained that the “BTC price level below $20,000
has been accompanied by diminishing volatility and volume, making it
increasingly difficult to predict the direction of the next move.”

Now that BTC appears to be trading in a descending triangle, traders
will watch $18,013 to see if the price can form a double bottom at the
triangle support. Below this level, the volume profile visible range and
market structure suggest that there is also support at $17,800.

If $17,800 fails to hold as support, Bitcoin price could drop to $17,200
then $16,400 which is near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. In a
previously published analysis, Micheal van de Poppe also pinpointed a
large CME gap from $18,275 to $16,995.

“Generally, 95% of the CME gaps get filled, which raises the probability
of price dropping back to these levels in the short term.” This suggests
that failure to hold the aforementioned levels as support heightens the
chance that Bitcoin price snatches the liquidity below and re-visits the
$17,000 level.
