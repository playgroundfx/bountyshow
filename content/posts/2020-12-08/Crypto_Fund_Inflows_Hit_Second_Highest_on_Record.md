NEW YORK (Reuters) - Institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s pumped $429 million into
cryptocurrency funds and products for the week ended Dec. 7, the second
highest on record, pushing the sector’s assets under management to an
all-time peak of $15 billion, according to Monday’s data from digital
asset manager CoinShares.

At the end of 2019, assets under management stood at just $2.57 billion.

Grayscale, the world’s largest crypto fund had $336.3 million in inflows
the latest week, lifting its assets under management to more than $12.4
billion. So far this year, Grayscale has amassed inflows of $4.3
billion, the Coinshares report said.

> “On an anecdotal level, based on our client conversations over the
course of 2020, we have seen a decisive shift from enquiries of a
speculative nature to those that begin with comments such as, ‘[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
is here to stay, please help us understand it’,” said James Butterfill,
investment strategist at CoinShares.

>

> “Given the levels of interest, this suggests we are only on the cusp
of institutional adoption rather than it cooling down.”

The largest weekly inflow on record was $468 million three weeks ago.

Bitcoin products and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-focused funds attracted inflows of $334.7
million last week. Inflows to the original cryptocurrency have totaled
nearly $4 billion so far this year.

The largest cryptocurrency in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market capitalization hit a
record high just under $20,000 last week but has since stalled at around
$19,000. It was last down more than 2% at $18,976.35.

In contrast, gold saw outflows from investment products of a record
US$9.2 billion over the last four weeks while [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) saw inflows
totalling $1.4 billion in the same period, the report said. But inflows
into gold products remained higher on the year at $45.7 billion.

Ethereum, the second largest digital currency, had $87.1 million in
inflows in the latest period. Investors have become more bullish on
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) likely because Ethereum management provided greater clarity on
the much-awaited upgrades that make the network much more efficient and
sustainable, the report said.
