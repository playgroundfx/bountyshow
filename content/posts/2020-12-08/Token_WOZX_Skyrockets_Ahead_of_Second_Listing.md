Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak’s new token, Efforce (WOZX), almost
doubled in price today after an astonishing run that saw the price
increase around 26X in the past week. WOZX will open for trading on
Korea-based exchange Bithumb on Dec. 9, and is already up 2,490% since
first being listed on the HBTC exchange on Dec. 3. It opened at 10 cents
per token and currently trades at $2.59.

Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) token WOZX is a way to securitize energy savings.
The token has a total supply of one billion and was sold via private
funding rounds conducted earlier this year, receiving an initial
valuation of $80 million. It reached a market cap of $950 million in its
first 13 minutes of trading, according to the eponymous company behind
the token, Efforce.

It is Wozniak’s second [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-related venture since co-founding
Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976. Touting itself as “the first
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-based energy saving platform,” Efforce aims to encourage the
reduction of energy consumption in a way that is meaningful but does not
disrupt current human behavior or routine. WOZX tokens will be used on
the platform by contributors who want to take part in energy-saving
projects and as rewards based on the amount of energy a user has saved.
