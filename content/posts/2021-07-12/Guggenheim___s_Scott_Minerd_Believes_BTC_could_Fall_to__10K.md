![Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd believes Bitcoin could fall to $10,000][1]

Scott Minerd, once one of Bitcoin’s biggest boosters, has seemingly lost
the faith. Minerd, Guggenheim’s chief investment officer, told CNBC
Friday he believes Bitcoin is in the midst of a serious crash that could
take it down to between $10,000 and $15,000. Just five months ago,
Minerd told CNN he believed the cryptocurrency could go as high as
$600,000. And in December, he told Bloomberg the firm’s fundamental
analysis showed it should be worth $400,000.

Bitcoin, like other cryptos, has been in an extended dive, falling from
more than $63,000 in mid-April to just over $33,500 in midday trading
Friday.

> “When we look at the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of crypto and we look at where we are, I
mean, I really do believe this is probably a crash. And, you know, a
crash would mean we’d be down 70% to 80%, which, let’s just say that’s
between $10,000 and $15,000,” he noted.
