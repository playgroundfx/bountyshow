with Coinplug, one of the earliest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchanges in South Korea and
a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) financial services provider.

Coinplug will be the largest shareholder in the joint venture with Woori
