Bitcoin has lost 2.5% on Wednesday, returning to $56.3K. It seems that
after a lull of a day-long, sellers’ pressure on the first
cryptocurrency has continued. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market
manages to remain positive, adding 0.3% in capitalisation over the past
24 hours.

A little over a month ago, Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market
capitalisation trended downwards. From a peak of 49.2% on October 19th,
its share has fallen to 41.7%. Optimistic market participants point to
impressive demand for altcoins, which is shaping the trend.

On the other hand, pessimists point out that without the market’s
flagship Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are more likely to reverse sooner
rather than later, recalling the situation in late 2017 and early 2018.

Behind the pressure on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a reduction in risk traction in
traditional finance, while retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue to look to
cryptocurrencies for insurance against devaluation and
speculative/investment potential. In addition, the way retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
participate in cryptocurrencies has changed over the past five years
since the previous cycle.

Cryptocurrency ICO and trading have migrated to crypto exchanges,
minimising some of the [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) risks of cryptocurrency creators. However,
the investment risks have not gone anywhere.

Of course, Bitcoin’s steady downward trend is eating away at crypto
enthusiasts’ optimism. Still, a smooth pullback like this acts as an
incentive for the market to look for new names, leaving Bitcoin to
conservative finance. The latter has only begun to regularly allocate a
share of their portfolio to crypto this year, filling it predominantly
with Bitcoin. At the same time, the leading edge of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s already
views the first cryptocurrency as too conservative and boring.
