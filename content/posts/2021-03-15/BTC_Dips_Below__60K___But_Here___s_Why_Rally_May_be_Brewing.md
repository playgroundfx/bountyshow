Bitcoin (BTC) pared some gains, dipping below $60,000 on March 14, a day
after setting a new all-time high of $61,950 on Binance. However, on-
chain data indicates that the uptrend is likely to continue in the near
term. One key metric that is signaling an optimistic short-term trend
for Bitcoin is the rise in stablecoin deposits into exchanges. Although
high funding rates and an overcrowded market are causing the price to
pull back, the entrance of sidelined capital into the crypto market may
further boost Bitcoin’s momentum. When Bitcoin enters price discovery
and hits a new record-high, the interest in the market naturally spikes.
There is a lot of liquidity in the current red-hot market, making it an
ideal period for whales and high-net-worth [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to take profit on
their positions.

brewing][1]

But despite, the halt in the rally, stablecoin inflows into exchanges
are rising once again, according to the latest data from CryptoQuant. In
the crypto market, traders often hedge their holdings against
stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USDC, rather than cashing out via
withdrawals to bank accounts. Typically, exchanges have a three to
seven-day processing period for cash deposits, and when traders want to
re-enter the cryptocurrency market, moving cash from their bank accounts
back to exchanges becomes cumbersome. Hence, when stablecoins begin to
flow into exchanges again — as seen by the green spikes in the chart
above — it suggests that sidelined capital may be looking to get back
into Bitcoin.

When Bitcoin rallies without a noticeable rise in stablecoin inflows, it
increases the probability of an unsustainable uptrend and a short-term
correction. If the trend of sidelined capital moving back into the
crypto market continues, there is a high probability that this will
further fuel Bitcoin’s momentum resulting in a broader rally.
