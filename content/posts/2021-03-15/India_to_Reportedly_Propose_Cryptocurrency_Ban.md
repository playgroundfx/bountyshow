India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading
in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government
official told Reuters in a potential blow to millions of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
piling into the red-hot asset class. The bill, one of the world’s
strictest policies against cryptocurrencies, would criminalize
possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring crypto-assets,
said the official, who has direct knowledge of the plan.

traders][1]

The measure is in line with a January government agenda that called for
banning private virtual currencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) while building a
framework for an official digital currency. But recent government
comments had raised [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ hopes that the authorities might go
easier on the booming market. Instead, the bill would give holders of
cryptocurrencies up to six months to liquidate, after which penalties
will be levied, said the official, who asked not to be named as the
contents of the bill are not public.

A government panel in 2019 recommended jail of up to 10 years on people
who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in
cryptocurrencies. The official declined to say whether the new bill
includes jail [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) as well as fines, or offer further details but said
the discussions were in their final stages. In March 2020, India’s
Supreme Court struck down a 2018 order by the central bank forbidding
banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies, prompting [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to pile into
the market. The court ordered the government to take a position and
draft a law on the matter.
