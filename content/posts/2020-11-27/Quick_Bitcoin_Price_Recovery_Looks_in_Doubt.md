Bitcoin may have a tough time charting a V-shaped recovery to recent
highs in the short term, with on-chain activity showing increased
selling pressure in the market. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s
exchange inflow indicator – which measures the 144-block (roughly
24-hour) average of mean [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) deposits across major cryptocurrency
exchanges – has risen to 2.5 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the highest level since March 20.

In other words, the average size of inward-bound transactions to trading
platforms has risen to eight-month highs. “The data shows whales [large
traders] are transferring their coins to exchanges,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki-
Young Ju told CoinDesk. “The cryptocurrency usually trades in a
sideways-to-negative manner when whales become active on exchanges.”
Bitcoin is trading near $16,820 at press time, representing a 2% drop on
a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency saw rejection above $17,400 early on
Friday. The possibility of prices falling to or below Thursday’s low of
$16,327 cannot be ruled out with average inflows now moving above 2
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) – into CryptoQuant’s “danger zone.”

A reading above 2.00 on the indicator has consistently paved the way for
notable price drops this year. The indicator rose above that level at
least a week before the 40% drop seen on March 12. Similarly, the sharp
sell-off seen in November 2018 was preceded by a sharp rise in the
metric. Technical chart studies indicate low odds of an immediate bounce
to levels above $19,000.
