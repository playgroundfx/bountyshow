Listed firms that deal in cryptocurrencies or have exposure to them saw
a field of green in global markets Wednesday, ahead of the much-
anticipated direct listing of crypto exchange Coinbase on the Nasdaq.
For instance, MicroStrategy, the data intelligence firm that has added
huge amounts of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to its balance sheet saw its shares up 18.5%
over the past few days, tracing a 7.8% jump Tuesday morning that
mirrored [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rise.

![Bitcoin Price Lifts Crypto Stocks Ahead of Coinbase Listing][1]

The emergence of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) proxy stocks in recent months has created a
cottage industry among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who want crypto’s upside but don’t (or
can’t) hold crypto itself. Indeed, JPMorgan filed to launch a
“Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket” in March. The need for backdoor access
to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is only heightened in the U.S., where the Securities and
Exchange Commission has been extremely reticent to approve a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)).

Also up in global trading was Colorado-based [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining company Riot
Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), which saw a 15% increase; and Canaan (NASDAQ:
CAN), another mining firm that saw an 11% bump over the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was near
all-time highs above $64,000 at press time.

Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), whose fortunes are closely wedded to the price
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), was slapped with a reference price of $250 ahead of
Wednesday’s listing – somewhat lower than trading on private markets in
the weeks running up to its debut. Coinbase coming to market is a rising
tide for all crypto players, said Jonathan Rowland, CEO of London-listed
cryptocurrency firm Mode, whose shares are up around 12% in the past few
days. “I don’t think we have seen an uptick as high as I might have
expected,” Rowland said in an interview. “We think that a lot of the
crypto community who invest in shares may have taken some money off the
table with some of the smaller holdings like Mode in order to buy
Coinbase.”
