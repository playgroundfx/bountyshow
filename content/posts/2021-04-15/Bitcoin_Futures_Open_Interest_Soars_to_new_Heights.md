Open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged to new record highs ahead of
Coinbase’s Wednesday direct listing on the Nasdaq. Crypto market data
[aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Glassode states that Bitcoin open interest has exceeded $27
billion for the first time as Bitcoin (BTC) pushed into new record highs
above $63,000. The milestone suggests traders may be speculating on
higher prices, although some may also be hedging against incoming
volatility.

The lion’s share of trading activity is on Binance, where the $5.2
billion in positions accounts for almost 20% of all outstanding
positions being held on the exchange. It’s followed by Bybit with $4.66
billion, OKEx with $3.75 billion, and then Huobi, FTX and CME with
roughly $3 billion each. Despite the record open interest, Bitcoin
futures volumes appear to have been declining over the past month,
sagging from $117 billion as of March 15 to range between $50 billion
and $75 billion during April, according to crypto derivatives data
[aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Skew.

The waning volume may suggest traders have become increasingly cautious
about opening new positions as the date for Coinbase’s listing was
approachin, with a significant share of open interest likely
representing positions that have been opened during previous weeks and
months. Of the $75 billion worth of BTC futures that changed hands over
the past 24 hours, Binance makes up more than one-third of the volume
with $26.9 billion, followed by Huobi with $14.5 billion, OKEx with
$12.7 billion and Bybit with $10.6 billion.

By contrast, open interest in Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) has declined since a
record $6 billion worth of contracts expired at the end of March.
Options volumes have increased during April, with the data suggesting
many traders have been hedging their positions as billions were
mobilized to protect against a crash down to $40,000 last week. Bitcoin
is not the only market that derivatives traders are speculating on, with
open interest in Ethereum futures also spiking to record highs above $8
billion as volumes increased over recent weeks.
