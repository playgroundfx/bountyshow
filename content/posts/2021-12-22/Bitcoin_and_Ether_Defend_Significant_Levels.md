The cryptocurrency market has gained another 1.8% over the past 24
hours, bringing its total capitalisation to $2.28 trillion. The index
has been choking on growth for the past three weeks at the $2.3 mark, so
further rise promises to strengthen the bullish case, at least in the
short term.

The cryptocurrency fear and greed index has jumped to 45. This is a fear
territory, but very close to neutral territory. Judging by the continued
demand for risky assets in traditional markets and the positive
performance of cryptocurrencies as of this morning, this index could
well continue to rise at the end of the day.

Bitcoin is trading near $49,000, returning to the highs of the last week
and a half, adding 1.3% in 24 hours and 2.3% over seven days.

Technically, the first cryptocurrency managed to close noticeably above
its simple 200-day moving average, which could spur demand from those
buyers who were waiting for the battle for that important level to
unfold.

The price of Ether is above $4K, which is also a positive signal for the
entire crypto market.

The situation looks like Ether staying above $4K and Bitcoin staying
above the 200-day average is fuelling buying among smaller altcoins.
Keeping key currencies above psychological marks fuels hopes that the
market has not switched to bearish mode.

On the other hand, we remain wary of the crypto market outlook, noting
that Bitcoin and Ether look like clinging to meaningful levels. The
bearish scenario can only be cancelled if growth develops from current
levels.
