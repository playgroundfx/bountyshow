After the Baghdad developments, rumors surfaced that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) touched
$24,000 per coin in Iran. Apparently, the demand for the most famous
cryptocurrency has grown amid the threat of a military conflict with the
U.S.

However, rumors, although not ill-grounded, remain only rumors generated
by a distorted perception of objective reality.

In fact, [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s, working in Iran, do business as
before, and the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price fluctuates here at around $7,000, as
everywhere else.

Meanwhile, the Iranian economy is already bursting at the seams under
protracted economic sanctions, and one presupposes that the situation
will only worsen.

If the fears are justified, the Iranian rial will depreciate, and people
will buy up [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and precious metals to protect their assets from
devaluation. And yet, contrary to statements in some media, Bitcoin is
still far from [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs in Iran.

How did these rumors appear?

Some Iranian cryptocurrency sellers raised prices up to 1 billion
Iranian reals per [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), triggering [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) with regard to unbelievable
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rates. If you count 1 billion riyals at the exchange rate to the
dollar, you get $24,000 for one [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

However, one should take into consideration that the official exchange
rate set by the Iranâ€™s Central Bank has nothing in common with the real
market rate, which is much higher. Such double rates are often found in
the countries with a weak national currency - one set by central bank,
and the second is regulated by the market.

As for the cryptocurrency rates for Monday, they are as follows:

  * Bitcoin gained 2.05 percent, to $7,526;

  * Ethereum added 3.49 percent, to $140,00;

  * Ripple surged by 7,97 percent, to $0,2108;

  * Bitcoin Cash rose by 5.60 percent, to $234;

  * Litecoin advanced 2.68 percent, to $44,46 at 1420 GMT.
