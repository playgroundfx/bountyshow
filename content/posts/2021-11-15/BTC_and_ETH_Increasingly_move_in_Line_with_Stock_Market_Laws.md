Bitcoin has been adding 1% since the start of the day and is almost
unchanged (-0.3%) to levels seven days ago at $65.8K. Consolidation in a
very narrow range for cryptocurrencies has been observed since last
Wednesday. However, this disposition is more on the bullish side.
Bitcoin has climbed another notch higher, gaining local support on the
dips to the previous resistance level at $63.5K.

The RSI index on the BTCUSD [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts remains impressively far from
overbought. The 50-day moving average is coming off the same degree of
the slope we saw about a year ago.

The cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index remains at 72, exhibiting a truly
narrow and persistent sideways trend, deviating weakly from this level
in the last five weeks. The index’s resilience on the edge of
overheating is a healthy sign of a bull market.

Overall in cryptocurrencies, the past seven days have seen profit-taking
processes or [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s jumping from one coin to another. The total
capitalisation of the crypto market has been virtually unchanged over
the past seven days, remaining near $2.87 trillion with Bitcoin and
$1.62 trillion excluding it.

Ethereum steadily gained support last week on a decline towards $4,500,
failing to confirm a move into a correction after an impressive rise
since early September.

In recent months, major cryptocurrencies, which have become an integral
part of investment portfolios, not just crypto enthusiasts, are becoming
more correlated with the mood of the stock market.

For example, we see pullbacks after highs have been updated, a more
pronounced correlation of risk appetite in equity markets and
cryptocurrencies, similar chart patterns and laws of technical analysis.

While the cryptocurrency market remains in its bullish phase, the
tendency towards consolidation is worrisome, shaping the market’s
advance in small steps.

Short-term sentiment markers for cryptocurrencies could be the exit of
Ether and Bitcoin from their mini ranges, $4500-4800 and $63500-68000,
respectively. The direction of the breakout could be a call to action
for the entire crypto market.
