China’s central bank said on Monday it had urged some banks and payment
firms to crack down harder on cryptocurrency trading, in the latest move
by Chinese authorities to stem the use of digital coins.

The People’s Bank of China’s statement sent [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) tumbling to a two-
week low and ether to a more than five-week low. On Tuesday, prices of
major cryptocurrencies stabilised.

## WHAT DID THE PBOC SAY?

The PBOC statement followed a meeting with banks and payment firms in
which it urged them to thoroughly check client accounts, identify those
involved in cryptocurrency transactions and promptly cut their payment
channels.

China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) and Postal Savings Bank of China
attended the meeting, along with Alipay, the ubiquitous payment platform
owned by fintech giant Ant Group.

Attendees vowed to comply. AgBank said that it would conduct due
diligence to root out illegal crypto-related activities and shut down
suspicious accounts, and Alipay said it would set up a monitoring system
targeting key [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s and accounts, and blacklist merchants involved in
virtual currency transactions.

## WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE CRACKDOWN?

The latest tightening makes it far more difficult for individuals in
China to trade cryptocurrencies, even through channels that have avoided
previous restrictions.

> “The law hasn’t changed, it’s just the enforcement,” said Bobby Lee,
founder and CEO of Ballet, a cryptocurrency wallet app, and formerly CEO
of BTC China, China’s first [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange.

The PBOC statement also effectively cuts off payment channels through
which mainland Chinese traders have acquired cryptocurrencies to trade
offshore.

> “Essentially this puts all the OTC platforms out of business...all the
OTC platforms were skirting the last ban, which was to not have
exchanges,” Lee said.

But banks and payment companies continue to face challenges of
identifying money flows related to cryptocurrencies. For now, Beijing
has not targeted the holding of digital coins.

> “Bitcoin is still at this point a legal digital asset for people to
own,” said Lee. “So maybe the final nail in the coffin, if it happens in
a few years, is they literally declare [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) illegal to possess.”

## HOW HAS CHINA SOUGHT TO REGULATE CRYPTO?

Last month, three industry associations banned crypto-related financial
services, and a meeting of the State Council’s Financial Stability and
Development Committee chaired by Vice Premier Liu He vowed a crackdown
on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining and trading as part of efforts to fend off financial
risks.

Bans on crypto mining have been issued in major [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining hubs,
including Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.

China’s crypto restrictions date to 2013, when financial regulators
banned banks and payment companies from providing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-related
services.

In September 2017, China banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), barred
financial firms and payment companies from providing services for ICOs
and cryptocurrencies, and banned cryptocurrency trading platforms from
converting between legal tender and cryptocurrencies.

The restrictions prompted most such platforms to shut down, with many
moving offshore.

## WHY HAS CHINA TIGHTENED REGULATION?

This year’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bull run revived cryptocurrency trading in China,
prompting warnings from regulators over financial risks and money
laundering.

With local exchanges shut down, many Chinese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have switched to
platforms owned by Chinese exchanges that had relocated overseas,
including Huobi and OKEx, or trade over-the-counter through online
platforms and social media trading chatrooms.

China-focused exchanges, which also include Binance and MXC, have
allowed Chinese individuals to easily open accounts online. They have
also facilitated peer-to-peer deals in OTC markets that help convert
Chinese yuan into cryptocurrencies. Traders make such transactions
through banks or online payment channels such as Alipay or WeChat Pay.

Retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have also been able to buy “computing power” from
cryptocurrency miners, who design various investment schemes that
promise quick and fat returns.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies’ potential threat to China’s fiat currency,
the yuan, has spurred the PBOC to launch its own digital currency.
