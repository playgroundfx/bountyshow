(Reuters) - Blockchain data platform Chainalysis said on Thursday it had
raised $100 million in its latest funding round led by investment firm
Coatue, taking its valuation to $4.2 billion.

The seven-year old company, which provides [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analysis software
to flag regulatory risks to [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s, government
agencies and financial institutions, plans to use the funds to deepen
its data coverage by adding more cryptocurrencies and further develop
its software.

As cryptocurrencies are finding more acceptance globally in the last few
months, [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data firms such as Chainalysis are seeing more demand
for their services due to increased regulatory scrutiny as these
currencies are highly volatile.

The company, which counts [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) holder Square Inc as one of its
customers and raised $100 million in its last funding round in March,
said it is hiring hundreds of new positions across all [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/).

Previous [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s including Benchmark, Accel, Addition, Dragoneer and
others increased their investment in the company, Chainalysis said,
adding that Blackstone, Sequoia Heritage, and SVB Capital, among others
also participated in the latest funding round.
