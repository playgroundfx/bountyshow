The newly appointed  European Central Bank (ECB) head Christine Lagarde
considers that Facebook can use its online platforms to advance Libra
and create a monopoly.

In a letter addressed to EU leaders last week, Lagarde noted that
stablecoins solve a lot of the problems connected to the cross-border
payments. They provide users with effective payment instruments and
contribute to the development of financial accessibility.

However, according to Lagarde’s opinion, regulators need to pay special
attention to issues related to market  stablecoin rivalry. Facebook can
gain an unfair dominance by promoting its coin on social networks and
blocking simultaneously competitors.

In addition, Lagarde has concerns that Facebook may use social media
data for its own purposes, which will also be a powerful advantage and
weaken the competitive environment in the industry.

She added that such stablecoins can be put into circulation only after a
comprehensive associative risk assessment. Work in this direction is
ongoing, but the international nature of Libra requires global
coordination and consistency in regulatory matters.

As for the rates of the traditional cryptocurrencies on Monday they are
as follows:

  * Bitcoin surged by 1.43 percent, to 7,525;

  * Ethereum added 0.34 percent, to 132,94;

  * Ripple lost 0.51 percent, to 0,1951;

  * Bitcoin Cash eased by 0.86 percent, to 195,20;

  * Litecoin slipped by 0.05 percent, to 41,9600;

  * Monero gained 1.05 percent, to 48,06 at 1419 GMT.
