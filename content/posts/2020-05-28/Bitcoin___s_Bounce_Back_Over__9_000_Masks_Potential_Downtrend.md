Bitcoin’s trading above $9,000 once again, but technical indicators
suggest the largest cryptocurrency is stuck in a funk. Though the price
level may provide support, Bitcoin needs to break out of the downtrend
it formed when its May high failed to take out the one reached in
February. Any further rally that withers before overcoming a previous
high may signal Bitcoin entered a potential downtrend, further
indicating bearish sentiment.

The token is facing bearish sentiment and “a healthy pullback might be
needed before it can break above the $10,000 level again,” Edward Moya,
senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note.

Bitcoin rose as much as 3.7% to $9,190 in New York trading on Wednesday.
Peer coins including Dash and Litecoin also advanced. Since its historic
halving event earlier this month, which reduced the rewards miners
receive, Bitcoin has been stuck in narrow range. Despite predictions the
event would help push up its price, the world’s largest digital token
has thus far failed to meaningfully climb above $10,000 — though many
enthusiasts forecast that a significant rally is still in the cards.

A number of high-profile [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, including Paul Tudor Jones, have in
recent days voiced their preference for the token amid colossal
interventions by central banks around the globe. Many argue Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies could benefit in an inflationary environment.
