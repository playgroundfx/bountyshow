The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen extreme volatility in the past 24
hours. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly rose by more than
800 points, BTC plunged in tandem with gold. Within five hours of
achieving a four-day peak at $15,840, the dominant cryptocurrency
abruptly plummeted 6.5%. Following the correction of BTC, analysts and
traders remain divided on its near-future prospects.

![BTC Outlook Still Bullish Despite Drop from Vaccine News][1]

The short-term pullback of Bitcoin, which happened within several hours,
was beneficial for BTC for three key reasons. First, it neutralized the
derivatives market, which is no longer overheated. Second, it led to a
healthy rejection of the $16,000 resistance level. Third, it showed that
even after a major price drop, overall buyer demand remains intact.

Pfizer’s vaccine neutralized the market  
On Nov. 9, Bitcoin saw a sharp drop from $15,840 to $14,805, which
occurred shortly after Pfizer announced its optimistic COVID-19 drug
trial results, having tested nearly 44,000 individuals and demonstrated
90% effectiveness. Subsequent to the announcement by Pfizer, major U.S.
stock market indices rallied by around 3%.

The highly anticipated breakthrough in the vaccine’s development caused
Bitcoin and gold to rapidly drop. Capital flew out of safe-haven assets
and stores of value to risk-on assets, like stocks, in a short period.
Consequently, gold recorded an intraday 4.5% drop, which is rare for an
asset of its size. It sparked the appetite for stocks and other risk-on
assets, which gave Bitcoin whales a narrative to sell.

When Bitcoin initially started dropping, whale inflows into
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s began to increase. This meant that high-net-
worth [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s holding large amounts of BTC were selling. Since Bitcoin
recovered back above $15,300 within six hours, whales likely bought back
at a lower price. Based on the trend, it’s probable that whales used the
narrative of the vaccine-induced correction to sell at resistance and
buy at a lower price.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin technical analyst Eric Thies said
that Bitcoin has essentially been fluctuating between two levels: the
$14,500 support and $16,000 resistance. Bitcoin rejected heavily as it
approached $16,000, indicating that there are large sell orders present
at the $16,000 resistance area. If BTC sees some consolidation under
$16,000, Thies noted that it would be beneficial for buyers:

> “We’ve seen Bitcoin breaking previous 2019 resistances for almost two
weeks now, and with price rapidly fluctuating between $14.5K and $16K,
bulls are in need of a consolidation period before we rapidly accelerate
towards hitting the 2017 high of $19,500.”

The short-term drop of Bitcoin was also critical to reset the futures
market. Prior to the drop, the funding rate of BTC futures contracts
across major exchanges was well over the average 0.01%. This meant that
the vast majority of the market was heavily longing or buying Bitcoin.
After the correction, the funding rate returned back to 0.01%, showing
that the futures market is no longer overheated.

The bull case for Bitcoin  
Various on-chain data metrics show that both miners and whales have been
selling BTC. The Miners’ Position Index on CryptoQuant hit a yearly high
on Nov. 5, indicating rising selling pressure from miners. Yet, the
price of Bitcoin has stayed relatively stable above $15,000 throughout
the past week, apart from several days.

This trend shows that new buyer demand is offsetting the selling
pressure coming from whales and miners. According to analysts at
Santiment, around $365 million worth of Tether (USDT) has moved to
exchanges [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) in the last seven days. Since most of the sidelined
capital within the crypto market is stored in stablecoins, it suggests
that new buyers are entering the market.

In the short term, however, one concerning metric that could cause
Bitcoin to consolidate for longer is the relative unrealized profit/loss
indicator. Philip Swift, the creator of educational platform Look Into
Bitcoin, said BTC is hovering in the “greed” zone on the indicator,
which, basically, measures how much unrealized profit [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
currently hold.
