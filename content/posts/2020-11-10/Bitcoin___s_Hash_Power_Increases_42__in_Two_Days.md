The hash power of the Bitcoin (BTC) network has jumped by roughly 30%
over the past 24 hours, which if sustained, suggesting a major
difficulty adjustment may soon be incoming. According to Coinwarz,
Bitcoin’s hash rate currently sits at 157.5 exahashes per second (EX/s)
after briefly pushing above 160 EH/s. As of this writing, BTC hash power
has increased by 42% in two days.

The spike follows a sharp decline in hash power in late October, which
many analysts attributed to the end of the rainy season in the Chinese
mining hub of Sichuan. The province’s abundant and cheap hydroelectric
power is estimated to attract around 80% of Chinese miners during the
wet season. In December, CoinShares estimated that Sichuan accounted for
54% of global mining activity.

Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane speculated that the sudden
increase in Bitcoin hash power could be a sign that many Chinese miners
have completed their migration from Sichuan and restored operations in
other local mining hubs such as Xinjian and Inner Mongolia. The sudden
spike in mining activity suggests the network is likely to produce
another significant difficulty adjustment.

A major upward adjustment would come at the chagrin of non-Chinese
miners who have been enjoying boosted profits after October’s apparent
migration from Sichuan resulted in a 16% negative difficulty adjustment
— the second-largest downwards adjustment in Bitcoin’s [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).
