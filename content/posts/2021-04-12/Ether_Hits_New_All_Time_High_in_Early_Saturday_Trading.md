Bitcoin’s price neared its all-time high of $61,712 early Saturday while
ether (ETH, -0.12%) set a new all-time high at $2,190. According to
CoinDesk’s Bitcoin price page, the leading cryptocurrency traded above
$60,000 for the first time in nearly a month after spending weeks
vacillating between $52,000 and the upper $50,000s. Bitcoin pulled back
marginally after peaking around $60,900, though it remains above the
psychological marker as of press time.

Bitcoin bulls were further bolstered on Friday by the idea that an
exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)) with exposure to the digital asset space
might be approved in 2021, after the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) confirmed it was reviewing [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) giant WisdomTree’s application. The
regulator previously began reviewing VanEck’s [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) application last
month, and another six companies have filed initial registration forms
declaring their own efforts to launch a regulated [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 0.38%)
investment vehicle.

The broader digital asset space has seen tremendous froth over the past
few months, with [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and industry participants trading heavily in
decentralized finance tools, non-fungible tokens and altcoins like doge,
which hit a peak of $0.08 in February, eight times its value a month
earlier.
