The G7 authorities - Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA,
France and Japan - negatively relate to the Facebook’s intention to
launch its own cryptocurrency. That’s why the social media giant decided
so far to consider the possibility of creating its own electronic
payment system.

It would be used in the system core the same Libra and that the new
project concept would be announced in the nearest future by Libra
consortium, which consists of  more than twenty companies and
organizations, including Facebook one of them.

Well, so far, Facebook doesn’t abandon the plan to issue its own
cryptocurrency, on the contrary, such a step is nothing but a project
extension.

On the other hand, experts note that if the Libra project would turn out
into the creation of a payment system, rather than a global
cryptocurrency, then ordinary U.S. citizens will not tell the difference
comparing with existing system like PayPal, for example.

Meantime, the Bitcoin rates rose by 0.27 percent, to $8,772 at 1421 GMT.

  * Bitcoin Cash eased by 1.75 percent, to $324,80;

  * Ethereum added 0.73 percent, to $225,33;

  * Ripple slipped by 0.04 percent, to $0,2343;

  * Litecoin lost 0.35 percent, to $60,57.

Recall, Facebook announced for the first time in 2019 its plan to launch
its cryptocurrency in the 2020. The company is sure, that digital
currency transactions will be as simple as sending a text message to the
phone. The new currency functioning will be based on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technology - a decentralized database, in which information storage
devices are not connected to a common server.

Even the U.S. Treasury Secretary responded to Facebook’s intentions,
commenting that the U.S. administration “expresses very serious concern
that Libra could be used by money launderers and terrorists.” Meantime,
the U.S. President blames the “low stability and reliability” of
cryptocurrencies, whereas G7 finance ministers warned that Libra could
negatively affect the whole international monetary system functioning.

One should remind, that Visa, eBay, PayPal and Mastercard got out the
Facebook’s project of Libra launch.

Mastercard refused to participate in the Facebook cryptocurrency
development, not only because of problems with financial regulators, but
also because of concerns about compliance with the previously announced
business model. According to him, key members of the Libra Association
could not guarantee that its actions would correspond to a legitimate
regarding money laundering, the “Know Your Client” (KYC) [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and
respect for data confidentiality.
