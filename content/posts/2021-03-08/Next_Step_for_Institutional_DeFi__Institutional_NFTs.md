The institutional appetite for decentralized finance (DeFi) is being
extended to incorporate the frothy world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Announced Tuesday, custody and wallet technology firm Trustology is
providing support for Ethereum-based NFTs, with a view to allowing
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to use these tokens as collateral, for example,
within the DeFi space.

![Next Step for Institutional DeFi? Institutional NFTs][1]

There’s currently an explosion happening in NFTs, which can be thought
of as [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-based title deeds to a digital artifact. The trend is a
carry-on from things like the original CrypoKitties phenomenon in 2017,
with the technology (Ethereum’s ERC-721 token standard) later morphing
its way deep into the world of digital art.

Today, the value being conferred on everything from art to music to
seminal tweets is measured in hundreds of thousands or even millions of
dollars. Meanwhile, institutional NFT is becoming a thing, with funds
like Delphi Digital, Scalar Capital and Sfermion investing in digital
collectibles.

Like DeFi, NFTs are normally associated with non-custodial wallets. But
a collection of valuable NFT assets being managed on the behalf of a
fund, for instance, would require a custody solution including rules to
allow certain individuals to lend the asset or use it as collateral,
said Batlin.
