Bitcoin mania has fuelled a surge in fundraising by Chinese companies
seeking to expand their cryptocurrency operations or move into the red-
hot sector.

From large listed companies tapping public markets to smaller players
raising funds from venture capitalists, a jump in [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s
and signs of growing acceptance of the technology by mainstream
institutions have fed the market boom.

Chinese [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining machine manufacturer, Ebang International
Holdings, which debuted on Nasdaq in June, conducted two fundraising
rounds in February alone, raking in $170 million, even after a previous
offering in November.

Newcomer Code Chain New Continent Ltd, a Chinese waste recycling
company, raised $25 million in February through a share placement to
fund a foray into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining.

In private markets, “competition is white hot and filled with sharp
elbows,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
venture capital firm Kenetic Capital. “Every good-quality funding round
is oversubscribed within a week of it being announced.”

The market has flourished despite complicated official attitudes towards
cryptocurrencies in China.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are banned and mining frowned upon, but there
is strong official support for developing [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology, which
underpins cryptocurrencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), but is also key to new
innovations in areas such as trade finance, supply chain management and
anti-counterfeiting.

This has contributed to the emergence of attractive crypto projects in
China, say [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, although many companies still list and raise money
overseas.

Ebang plans to use its new capital to expand into cryptocurrency mining
in its own right, to open [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s in Singapore and
Canada, and to launch a Robinhood-style platform for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading.

> “Ebang’s growth story is very attractive to institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
... fundraising by all industry players is getting busier thanks to the
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bull,” said Guo Yi, COO at Univest Securities, which underwrote
the deals, and has helped raise money for several other Chinese crypto
players.

Canaan Inc, another Nasdaq-listed Chinese maker of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining
machines, is also expanding into mining, where powerful computers are
used to verify [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) transactions and compete for a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) reward.

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has surged over 300% in
value since the fourth quarter of last year.

> “Bitcoin prices present us with a unique opportunity to establish
mining operations,” said David Feng, co-CEO of newcomer Code Chain,
which has ordered 10,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining machines.

“EUPHORIC ATMOSPHERE”

The Chinese rush comes as Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency
exchange, filed last month for a Nasdaq listing. Regulatory approval
would represent a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates seeking
mainstream endorsement.

> “Everyone can feel this euphoric atmosphere in the market, and
Coinbase’s listing would lift the mood further,” said Jiang Changhao,
co-founder and chief technology officer of Beijing-based Cobo a crypto
custodian and wallet service provider.

>

> Cobo plans to launch a new round of venture capital funding this month
to finance international expansion, aiming for tens of millions of
dollars because, Jiang said, “the market is bullish and our business is
growing very, very rapidly.”

Kenetic Capital’s Chu said official backing for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), and the use
of the technology in major initiatives by giants like Ping An and Ant
Financial, were a factor in the number of high quality [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and
crypto projects in China.

But the recent price surge had “poured napalm” on to competition in the
sector, he said.

Still, the entry of some Chinese firms into the crypto space has raised
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) eyebrows.

Last month, short-sellers Hindenburg Research and Culper Research
alleged Chinese [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) firm SOS Ltd, had made false claims about its
cryptocurrency business, allegations SOS said were “distorted,
misleading and unsubstantiated”.

Guo of Univest Securities said the market has zero-tolerance toward
cheating, but there’s nothing improper about Chinese companies jumping
on to the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bandwagon.

> “If people don’t point figure at (Tesla founder) Elon Musk for
endorsing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), what’s wrong with Chinese companies embracing it?”
