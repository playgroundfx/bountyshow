When Elon Musk’s Tesla became the biggest name to reveal it had added
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to its coffers last month, many pundits were swift to call a
corporate rush towards the booming cryptocurrency.

Yet there’s unlikely to be a concerted crypto charge any time soon, say
many finance executives and accountants loath to risk balance sheets and
reputations on a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that confounds
convention.

> “When I did my treasury exams, the thing we were told as number one
objective is to guarantee security and liquidity of the balance sheet,”
said Graham Robinson, a partner in international tax and treasury at PwC
and adviser to the UK’s Association for Corporate Treasurers.

>

> “That is the fundamental problem with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), if those are the
objectives for treasurers, then breaking them could get them in
trouble.”

Tesla Inc’s $1.5 billion [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bet saw it join business software firm
MicroStrategy Inc and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square
Inc in swapping some traditional cash reserves for the digital coin.

Proponents of the cryptocurrency see it as a hedge against inflation at
a time of unprecedented government stimulus, a falling dollar and
record-low interest rates that make attractive high-yielding assets hard
to find.

While the moves have prompted more boardroom discussions though,
headaches from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s volatility to accounting for it and storing it
are likely to preclude a big wave of companies holding large amounts on
balance sheets in the short term, according to over a dozen financial
officers, board members and accountants interviewed by Reuters.

> “It will take more than a small handful of disruptive companies
investing in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to impact the narrative in boardrooms,” said Raul
Fernandez, an entrepreneur and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who sits on the audit committee
of the board of chipmaker Broadcom Inc as well as other companies.

> “Larger global companies, I can’t see those conversations happening
right now.”

## BITCOIN’S INTANGIBLE TANGLE

One problem could lie in the devil of the accounting detail in a
bookkeeping industry that, like many others, is still taking stock of
the nature of cryptocurrencies.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting
standards for U.S. corporations, does not have guidance specific to the
accounting for cryptocurrencies. However, consistent with discussions
among a separate U.S. trade body, companies apply existing FASB guidance
on the accounting for “intangible assets”, which usually includes
intellectual property, brand recognition or goodwill.

Under these rules, companies other than investment firms or broker-
dealers cannot book gains in the value of holdings should the price of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rise - but must write down their investment as an impairment
charge if it falls.

Furthermore, once a company writes down its holdings, it cannot record
subsequent gains until it sells.

By contrast, companies periodically reflect the impact of fluctuations
in traditional currencies in their financial statements.

The FASB has no immediate plans to review its treatment of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as
the issue affects few of its constituents, according to a source
familiar with the matter.

> “I don’t think it’s the best accounting so far,” said Robert Hertz, a
former FASB chairman. “I am hoping that if more mainstream companies get
into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the accounting standards board may revisit the accounting
treatment.”

Outside the United States, cryptocurrencies are usually treated as
intangible assets too. But in contrast to guidance under the FASB rules,
writedowns can be reversed in future years. In certain cases, companies
can record [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at market value. See EXPLAINER:

## COMPANIES’ CRYPTO BILLIONS

Publicly listed companies together hold around $9 billion of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
data from the Bitcoin Treasuries [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) shows. Around 80% is held by
Tesla and MicroStrategy, the latter with over $4.5 billion.

Square, which allows users to buy and sell [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), said last month it
had added an additional $170 million of the virtual coin to its coffers.

Of course, if the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rises, a company can always simply
sell its holdings, thus realising some gains. Yet it is still a risky
investment, given the cryptocurrency’s record of wild swings.

In 2013, for example, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) started at around $13 and spiked to over
$1,000. In 2017, it went from about $1,000 to around $20,000. In early
2020, it sunk below $4,000. It fell more than 25% late last month only a
week after hitting a record high above $58,000. It has now recovered
part of its losses.

About 5% of chief financial officers (CFOs) and senior finance leaders
said they planned to hold [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on their balance sheets in 2021, a
survey of 77 executives by U.S. research firm Gartner found last month.

Some 84% of respondents said they did not plan to ever hold it as a
corporate asset, citing volatility as the top concern, followed by board
risk aversion, slow adoption as a widespread method of payment and
regulatory issues.

> “I think for the most part you will find companies will avoid that
sort of thing,” said Jack McCullough, president of the CFO Leadership
Council and a former CFO.

>

> “CFOs are likely to be very conservative in managing corporate
treasuries. They’re happy sinking money into very safe places with low
interest. Their job is to help grow the company through its operations,
and the treasury needs to be safe and secure.”

## WHY PUT MY NECK ON THE LINE?

Cryptocurrency supporters, however, say the rationale for companies to
buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is clear, not least the decline of the dollar - the dominant
reserve currency - which has fallen about 4.5% against a basket of major
currencies in the past year.

> “The value of the dollar over time is getting weaker and weaker,” said
Dave Sackett, CFO of ULVAC Technologies Inc, the U.S. subsidiary of a
Japanese vacuum equipment maker, and an active cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).

>

> “Bitcoin flips the script on that.”

Sackett pitched ULVAC executives on investing in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) last April,
suggesting they take a chance and then cash out with potential gains.
They passed on the opportunity, he said.

Other potential headaches for executives include questions over how a
company can safely hold a cryptocurrency, and how much it should
disclose to shareholders about security precautions, said Tim Davis,
principal in the financial and risk [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y practice at Deloitte &
Touche, which advises firms on holding crypto on their balance sheets.

High-profile thefts from exchanges have highlighted problems over safely
storing digital assets. The loss of passwords for digital wallets is
also a risk. Offline or “cold” storage is widely seen as the best
defence against hackers but there are few, if any, regulatory standards.

> “Do you custody it yourself?” Davis said. “Do you have an exchange
custody it? How much of it do you want to have in a hot wallet versus a
cold wallet?”

Ultimately, experts added, the expansion into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) by companies
without existing ties to the cryptocurrency market may depend on the
willingness of financial executives to take on risk.

> “The general consensus among treasurers is that very few of them are
going to follow this trend initially,” said Naresh Aggarwal at the UK’s
Association for Corporate Treasurers.

>

> “As a treasurer, if I am right and the price doubles, the company may
sell its holding and make a profit. Whilst the company may be worth
more, it won’t be reflected in my compensation,” he added.

>

> “But if the price falls, I am pretty confident I will be fired. Why
bother putting my neck on the line?”
