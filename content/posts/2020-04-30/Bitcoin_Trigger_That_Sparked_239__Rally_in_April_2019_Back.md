Bitcoin resumed its winning streak Wednesday as its price edged further
closer towards $8,000. The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)-to-dollar exchange rate rose 1.53
percent to $7,878 a token, a move that brought the pair above its
20-weekly exponential moving average. The price curve was instrumental
in sending [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) up by 239 percent back in 2019 – from $4,051 to
$13,868 on Coinbase.

A break above the 20-WMA in January 2020 also led the prices up by 28.62
percent to above $10,000. Nevertheless, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) failed to extend the
rally as the coronavirus-induced fears led [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to panic-sell their
crypto positions in March 2020. But the cryptocurrency’s break above the
20-WMA this time comes ahead of its mining reward halving. The event
would reduce [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) supply output from 1,800 BTC to 900 BTC.
The last two halvings resulted in exponential price rallies. Traders
anticipate the third event would lead to a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price boom.

Breaking above 20-WMA not always resulted in exponential price gains. In
2018, when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was undergoing one of its longest bearish
corrections, it broke above the curve on nine weekly occasions but
failed every time to hold it as support. But, at the same time, there
was one additional fractal at play. Bitcoin was trading above its
50-weekly moving average, or 50-WMA, on 7 out of 9 occasions. The
cryptocurrency used the long-term wave as its support to retest 2o-WMA
but failed to pierce above it for too long.

The doubtful scenario has not deterred [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) from registering short-
term gains. The cryptocurrency could still rise towards $9,000 to test
50-WMA for a breakout – the wave is near $8,700 as on April 29. On the
other hand, a real upside break could lead [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) towards
$10,000-$11,000 resistance, especially amidst the halving FOMO. That is
evident with the rising number of accumulators ahead of halving, as
reported by data analyst Glassnode.
