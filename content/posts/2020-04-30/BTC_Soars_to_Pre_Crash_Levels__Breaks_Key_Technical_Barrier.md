The price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC) is once again seeing strong gains in the
crypto market today, after soaring to levels not seen since before
crypto’s “Black Thursday” on March 12, and again positioning the asset
above a key technical level in the chart. (Updated at 14:50 UTC, when
BTC trades at USD 8,338)

As of press time (11:40 UTC), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is up by 4.55% to a price of USD
8,150. The price means that the number one cryptocurrency today has
finally broken above the 8,000 mark, which happened to also coincide
with the widely followed 200-day moving average level. If the price
closes above both of these levels, technical analysis suggests that
bullish momentum is strong and that further gains may be ahead of us.

Following the latest price gains, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has now recovered all of its
losses from the severe decline on March 12 and 13, often referred to as
crypto’s “Black Thursday,” which brought it down nearly 50%. This is
obviously also an important psychological milestone for the market,
given earlier comments from prominent [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s like Mike Novogratz that
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) needs to “rebuild confidence.”

The price gains in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) were also accompanied with strong performance
in several other major cryptoassets, such as [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) (ETH) and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
cash (BCH), which were up by 5.2 and 4.6%, respectively, over the same
time period.

Despite the currently optimistic sentiment in the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market,
however, some also point out that the price moves in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may be more
closely correlated to the traditional financial market than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
proponents like to believe. For instance, Bloomberg editor Joe
Weisenthal noted today that “Bitcoin continues to basically track S&P
futures,” although with a “higher beta,” meaning volatility.

Whatever the case may be, it is clear that today’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) strong rally
has by far outperformed the stock market, with S&P 500 futures currently
indicating an open a mere 0.88% higher.

Meanwhile, Christel Quek, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-founder at
Bolt Global, told Bloomberg that while BTC should rise into USD 10,000s
after the halving, it could be followed with a price drop as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
engage in profit taking as “no level of technical support can stand when
the economy is drained.”

> “The impact of COVID-19 so close to the halving and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s
correlation to equity markets means we may not see significant surges in
price due to the halving,” Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO at
CryptoCompare, added.
