Bitcoin price has soared from $7,700 to $9,500 in 24 hours, mainly
driven by three key factors that triggered the short-term rally. The
Bitcoin (BTC) price increased from $7,700 to $9,500 overnight,
increasing by 23%, according to Coinmarketcap, in less than 24 hours.

The three main factors that catalyzed Bitcoin’s recent rally are record-
high spot exchange volume, a breakout above [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) resistance
levels, and a noticeable rise in institutional demand.

In crypto, the term spot exchange refers to a platform that facilitates
fiat to crypto trades. On Binance and Coinbase, for instance, users can
trade Bitcoin with USD or stablecoins like Tether (USDT) without
leverage. Volumes coming from spot exchanges are not inflated by
leverage or borrowed capital. Spot volumes typically demonstrate
authentic retail demand and they often increase during an accumulation
phase.

Unlike past rallies, the recent upsurge of Bitcoin was primarily led by
spot volumes. Binance and Coinbase saw record high [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volumes, as
shared by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The demand for Bitcoin on Coinbase
reached a point where the exchange could no longer handle user activity
for a temporary period.

All the while, the open interest of Bitcoin futures on BitMEX stayed
below $500 million. The open interest of Bitcoin on BitMEX, which refers
to the total amount of short and long contracts open in the market,
remained above $1 billion in February 2020.

The relatively low volume of Bitcoin on futures exchanges and the
dominance of spot platforms indicate that the upsurge from $7,700 to
$9,500 was organic. According to a cryptocurrency trader known as
Benjamin Blunts, the Bitcoin price broke all major [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) resistance
levels when it first surpassed $8,000. The 100-day and 200-day [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
moving averages (DMA) and the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level were all
broken simultaneously.

The quarterly report of Grayscale, which operates the Grayscale Bitcoin
Trust, said that 88% of investments came from institutions. In the same
period, the assets under management (AUM) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust
just hit $3 billion, according to its CEO Barry Silbert. “88% of inflows
this quarter came from institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the overwhelming
majority of which were hedge funds,” said the investment firm.

The gradual increase of inflow in capital into institutional products of
Grayscale since January 2020 indicates that institutions consistently
invested in Bitcoin throughout the first quarter. A significant increase
in organic retail demand resulting in surging spot volume, the breach of
key resistance levels, and the accumulation of institutions created a
perfect storm for Bitcoin ahead of halving, pushing it above $9,000.
