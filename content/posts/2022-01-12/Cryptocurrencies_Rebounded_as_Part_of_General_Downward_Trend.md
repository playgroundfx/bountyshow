The value of the cryptocurrency market rose almost 3% over the past 24
hours to 2.07 trillion. Exceeding the psychologically important circular
mark pulled demand for coins outside the top 10.

Separately, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) enjoyed demand from the pull into risky assets in
traditional financial markets and the weakening dollar. Bitcoin has
fallen slightly short of the entire crypto market since the beginning of
the week, pushing its share down to 40%.

However, it is too early to say that a new rally in crypto has begun.
The crypto market remains 30% below its peaks in early November, and
capitalisation growth is uneven.

Interestingly, the cryptocurrency fear and greed index lost 1 point to
21 overnight, despite increasing market cap.

Yesterdayâ€™s rise did not gain traction at the start of the day on
Thursday. Fixing above $45K against $43.5K now would confirm the
strength of the bulls. It is reasonable to talk about a rebound within
the descending channel until that time.

If the dollar goes back to growth in the nearest future, it will
pressure stock markets. The cryptocurrency market, in these
circumstances, risks reversing back to the downside, stopping the
rebound and remaining in a prolonged downtrend channel. We should be
wary of a smooth decline like this, as it drains optimists. We saw a
similar descent in 2018 when the fall became uniformly smooth in the
second half of the year, and a wide range of crypto-enthusiasts switched
to standby mode until mid-2020.
