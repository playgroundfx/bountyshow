The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) has warned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
about the risks of Bitcoin futures trading — citing market volatility, a
lack of [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) to name a few issues. In a June 10 Investor
Alerts bulletin, the SEC outlines key points that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should
“carefully consider” before investing in a fund that buys or sells
Bitcoin futures.

> “Investors should understand that Bitcoin, including gaining exposure
through the Bitcoin futures market, is a highly speculative investment,”
the bulletin read. This latest Bitcoin-related risk warning from the SEC
follows up on a note it sent out last month, warning [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
“interested in investing in a [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) with exposure to the Bitcoin
futures market” to think twice due to the risks.

The latest warning notes that while investments in all types of funds
involve risk, funds that “buy or sell Bitcoin futures may have unique
characteristics and heightened risks compared” to others: “Investors
should consider the volatility of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin futures
market, as well as the lack of [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and potential for [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) or
manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market.”
