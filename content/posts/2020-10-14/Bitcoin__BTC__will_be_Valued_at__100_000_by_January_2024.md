The author behind a valuation model for Bitcoin that’s based on
Metcalfe’s Law says the crypto asset will likely be priced around
$12,000 by the end of November and reach $1 million within a decade.

In an Oct. 11 Twitter thread, Timothy Peterson, Global Macro Manager at
Cane Island Alternative Advisors, said there is “90% chance that Bitcoin
will never again close below $11K.” Disclaimer: While he’s deadly
serious, the prediction recalls the oft stated meme about the “last
chance” to buy Bitcoin under $10K, which has frequently been proven
wrong.

However, the analyst claims his model, which he first devised in 2017,
has been more or less accurate so far. Peterson claimed to have
successfully predicted the end of year prices of the cryptocurrency in
the past two years. For 2018, he predicted a price of $3,500 — the
actual price on Dec. 31 was $3,782, a difference of only 7%. Peterson
also predicted a mid-range estimate of $7,000 for the end of 2019. The
recorded price of Bitcoin was $7,243 on that day.

Using these methods, the analyst estimates Bitcoin (BTC) will be valued
at $100,000 by January 2024 and $1 million by March 2028. He also issued
a very specific prediction about the exact price on November 30 to
naysayers who doubt the accuracy of his model:

Peterson’s “lowest price forward” model is a competitor to the most
popular Bitcoin valuation model, stock-to-flow (S2F), created by Crypto
Twitter user PlanB, that predicts a Bitcoin price of $288,000 by the
next halving.

However, ByteTree co-founder and chief investment officer Charlie Morris
recently authored a report attempting to debunk the S2F model. Morris
argues that since Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, the demand is more likely
to determine the price, and pointed out the economic role of Bitcoin
miners is diminishing over time. “There are many reasons why the price
of Bitcoin can rise or fall,” said Morris. “But S2F is not one of them.”
