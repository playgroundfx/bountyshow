More than half of Ethereum’s circulating supply has not moved in more
than a year, with only 39.6% of Ether (ETH) changing hands over the past
12 months. According to Glassnode’s ‘hodlwaves,’ which offers a
chronological breakdown of the velocity of on-chain transactions,
roughly 28% of Ether last moved between the past 12 and 24 months —
comprising the largest segment of on-chain activity.

The data suggests that many whales spent 2019 accumulating Ether in
advance of the project’s ETH 2.0 overhaul — for which phase 0 is
expected to commence in the coming months, allowing users to stake their
Ether for the first time. Around 20% of tokens have not moved since
before October 2017, with analysts watching to see if a percentage of
these coins are moved into staking with the roll-out of phase 0.

Phase 0’s coming launch appears to have sparked a recent increase in the
short-term velocity of on-chain transfers, with the share of Ether moved
in the past 24 hours increasing from less than 0.5% during January and
February to average more than 1% in early September. Weekly velocity
also increased from 1.5% at the start of the year to tag 5% in both July
and September, while monthly and quarterly transfers similarly increased
steadily since June.
