On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency market decided to push and grow amid
the rise of US stock indices. The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, while the high-
tech Nasdaq gained 2.1%. All this helped Bitcoin shrug off the profit-
taking sentiment at the start of the day and close in a slight plus. On
the intraday chart, you can see purchases at the close of the American
session, which clearly demonstrate the interest of the institutionalists
in this region.

The benchmark cryptocurrency continues to be in demand after
strengthening above the 50-day moving average, which confirms the
breaking of the downtrend of the previous three months. The RSI
indicator on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts is now at 61, still far from the
overbought zone, confirming that the market is still far from
overheating.

For the third week in a row, institutional participants have been
investing in crypto funds, according to CoinShare. Why did they start
doing this before the January meeting of the Fed, when no one believed
in the BTC reversal.

Crypto-whales also bought [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) after the fall. According to
Santiment, they have purchased 220,000 BTC in the last seven weeks.

On Thursday, US inflation data will be released, which will shed light
on how quickly the Fed will raise rates. If inflation accelerates, all
risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, may suffer significantly.

Ethereum rose 3.8%, other leading altcoins from the top ten also showed
growing dynamics from 0.2% (Terra) to 5.2% ( XRP).

The total capitalization of the crypto market grew by 2.2% over the day,
to $2.14 trillion. Altcoins showed outpacing growth, which led to a
decrease in the Bitcoin dominance index by 0.4%, to 39.6%.
