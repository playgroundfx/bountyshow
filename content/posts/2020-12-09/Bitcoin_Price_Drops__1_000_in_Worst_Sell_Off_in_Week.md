Bitcoin has fallen precipitously in the past few hours and is testing a
key level of psychological support near $18,000. At around 06:00 UTC on
Dec. 8, the price of the world’s first cryptocurrency fell to around
$18,031 from $18,770. It subsequently retraced slightly to $18,200 by
press time, according to CoinDesk’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price index.

The last time [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -6.30%) experienced a similar drop was on
Dec. 1 after the bellwether cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of
around $19,920, per the BPI. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of
CryptoQuant, the availability of sizable amounts of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on exchanges
provided by large holders – “whales,” as they are often called –
contributed to the price drop.

> “When it comes to short-term price prediction, I think the most
important data is supply and demand, said Ki Young Ju, CEO of
CryptoQuant. “I think this plummet was started from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)…whales who
wanted to keep their [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on exchanges making them readily available
for sell orders.”

Others see recent buyers taking their winnings out of the market. Lucas
Huang, head of growth at decentralized exchange Tokenlon, noted that
from a retail trading perspective, “an 80% increase in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price
over only two months might be a profit too tempting not to take.”

Meanwhile, another signal may be coming from how Wall Street views the
prospects of one particularly large buyer in recent months. Tyler Radke,
an analyst at Citibank, downgraded his recommendation on business
intelligence firm Microstrategy to “sell” from “neutral,” flagging to
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) euphoria might be overextended.

Other notable cryptocurrencies are also suffering, including ether, XRP
(XRP, -13.85%) and [Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/) (LTC, -10.52%). Those three are down between
7% and 9% in the past 24 hours as well. In fact, all 17 free-floating
cryptopcurrencies besides [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in the CoinDesk 20 have dropped
between 6% and 12% in the past day.

Meanwhile traditional markets have held steady on the day with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average closing 0.35% in the green and the S&P 500
index up around 0.28% on the day.
