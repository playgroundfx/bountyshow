HONG KONG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Singapore affiliate of Binance, one of
the world's largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s, said on Monday it will
withdraw its local licence application and wind down its digital payment
token business in the broadly crypto-friendly city-state.

The company, which has come under growing scrutiny globally, did not
give a reason for its decision beyond "strategic, commercial and
developmental" considerations and said it would refocus the local unit's
operations on becoming a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) innovation hub.

Governments and financial watchdogs around the world have intensified
scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry this year, posing a challenge to
exchanges that have thrived in a mostly unregulated environment.

Singapore is a popular location for cryptocurrency firms due to a
comparatively clear regulatory and operating environment and is among
the forerunners globally in developing a formal licensing framework.

Binance's Singapore unit was one of well over 100 cryptocurrency
companies to apply for a license to operate in Singapore and had been
allowed do business while its license request was being processed.

Singapore issued its first licences this year, including to a unit of
southeast Asia's largest bank DBS, however dozens of others have been
withdrawn or rejected.

Binance said its Singapore platform for trading fiat and
cryptocurrencies will close by mid-February. In September, the company
said that because of local [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), users in Singapore would not be
able to trade on its global platform.

> "I think this signifies again Singapore's licence regime is quite
stringent," said Chia Hock Lai, co-chairman, Blockchain Association
Singapore.

>

> "Having said that, Binance also stated that Singapore will remain as
their [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) innovation hub, so it is still consistent with the
narrative that Singapore is a very important [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) hub."

Financial regulators in Hong Kong, Britain, Germany, and Japan among
others have targeted Binance, raising issues such as consumer protection
and anti-money laundering checks. Some have banned the platform from
certain activities, while others have warned consumers that it was
unlicensed to operate.
