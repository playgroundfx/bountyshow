Celebrity [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Kevin O’Leary says he will only buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mined
sustainably in countries that use clean energy — and not “blood coin”
mined in China. “I see over the next year or two, two kinds of coin,” he
told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Monday. “Blood coin from China,
(and) clean coin mined sustainably in countries that use
hydroelectricity, not coal.”

Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, and around 65% of the
world’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was mined in China as of April 2020, according to
Statista. “I’m going on the side of clean coin,” said O’Leary.

The chairman of O’Shares [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s once called [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) “garbage,” but changed
his mind more recently and said he would allocate 3% of his personal
portfolio to the cryptocurrency, according to a CoinDesk report.
Increasingly, many large institutions impose restrictions on assets they
will hold in order to comply with environmental and corporate governance
rules. Concerns include human rights and carbon emissions. O’Leary said
whether products are made in China is also a consideration.
