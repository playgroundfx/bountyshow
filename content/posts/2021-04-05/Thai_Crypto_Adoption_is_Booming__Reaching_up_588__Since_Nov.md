Crypto adoption appears to be booming in Thailand, with the local
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, estimating domestic crypto
volumes have increased by nearly 600% since November. Data compiled by
the Thai’s SEC and published by Bloomberg indicates combined volume
across licensed Thai crypto exchanges increased from 574.5 million in
November to $3.96 billion in November.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Atichanan Pulges, co-founder of top Thai exchange
Bitkub, estimated volume on his platform had increased by 40% between
January and February. Pulges claimed Bitkub represents 90% of local
trade activity and services 300,000 customers. Despite the surge in
licensed crypto volumes, Thai peer-to-peer trading has seen
comparatively muted growth.

While roughly $650,000 worth of Bitcoin traded weekly on top P2P
marketplaces Local[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s and Paxful combined during November,
February’s volumes oscillated between roughly $700,000 and $1 million —
an increase of between approximately 10% and 50%. During March, Thai P2P
Bitcoin trade volumes slumped from $950,000 to roughly $600,000.

In response to the increasing popularity of crypto, Thailand’s SEC has
proposed introducing a training course and test to restrict
inexperienced traders from speculating on crypto assets. Last month, the
commission also hinted it will introduce a $32,000 minimum annual income
requirement for domestic crypto traders.
