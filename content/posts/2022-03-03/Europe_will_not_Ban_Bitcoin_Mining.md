The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, decreased by 2.5% to $1.09 trillion. The Bitcoin
Dominance Index is hovering around 43.1%. The Cryptocurrency Fear and
Greed Index fell 13 points to 29, once again ending up in the fear zone.

From the technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin slowed down ahead of
strong mid-February resistance at $45,000, which then turned the move
down. The first cryptocurrency in recent days has not paid too much
attention to stock indices, which rose on Wednesday. The technical
picture continues to point to a break in the downtrend, although to
confirm the reversal, the rate must first fix above 45K.

In the EU, it was previously discussed that since Bitcoin and Ethereum
use the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which consumes a lot of
electricity and has a negative impact on the environment, itâ€™s time to
ban the mining of these cryptocurrencies. However, it was decided to
abandon this idea following the new version of the bill on digital
assets.
