CSRC, the Chinese financial regulator, got a request for listing an [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/),
which is seen to trail [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) stocks, as it became known due to the
CoinDesk [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

The request was completed by the Penghua Fund Management Co. and
directed to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Dec.
24th. It was presupposed, that the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) would track the moves
of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-based companies which are traded on the SSE.

In case this application gets the CSRC approval it would be launched the
first [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) available to a wide range of Chinese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
Recall, earlier, the SSE broughtÂ  included those companies, which were
present on the SSE for more than six months. Moreover, the companies
should not have troubles with regulators nor violations in the financial
field

It was also carefully checked whether the company really uses
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). The index is weighted by the market value of shares in free
circulation and will be updated twice a year.
