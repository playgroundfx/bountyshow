At around 23:05 UTC (7:05 p.m. Eastern Time), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC) rose from
$9,895 to around $10,429 over the course of 30 minutes as a new wave of
volatility greeted the end of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) closing period for June 1.

The large spike in BTC’s price comes as violence erupts on the sixth day
of protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis
police. BTC has since cooled slightly and is currently changing hands
for around $10,191, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

BTC’s price action was equally matched by a large injection of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
trading volume on the Bitstamp and Binance exchanges. Meanwhile,
Coinbase suffered a temporary outage that had been resolved as of press
time.

Bitcoin has been gyrating between $8,600 and $10,000 for a period of
around 32 days and finally broke above the $10,000 psychological
resistance in convincing fashion as traders sought to capitalize on a
bullish technical setup.

> “ETH broke out already, BTC now having its turn,” said Joshua Green,
chief investment officer at Orthogonal Trading.

> “The macro and fundamental scenario is very bullish, and the market
has been shorting into $10,000, under-allocated above $10,000,” Green
added.
