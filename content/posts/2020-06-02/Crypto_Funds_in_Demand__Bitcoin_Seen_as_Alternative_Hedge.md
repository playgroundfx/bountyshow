Grayscale Investments has been gobbling up Bitcoin in recent months, and
most of its [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are institutions — but other funds are doing it,
too.

While the theater world has Waiting for Godot, the crypto sphere has its
own drama: Waiting for the Institutional Investor. Recently, there have
been some promising sightings. Grayscale Investments has been buying up
Bitcoin (BTC) at a great rate in recent months.

Indeed, since the May 11–12 rewards halving event, the fund has been
accumulating BTC at a rate equivalent to 150% of all the new Bitcoin
mined, Cointelegraph reported on Thursday. The firm now has $3.2 billion
in assets under management, or AUM, in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.
Significantly, more than 90% of new inflows are from institutional
players, according to the company.

Hedge][1]

Grayscale may not be alone in attracting institutional attention. Eric
Ervin, the president and CEO of Blockforce Capital, an asset management
firm that operates in the crypto space, told Cointelegraph: “We are
seeing more institutional interest. I think this would be true
regardless of the halving or the QE taking place, even more so given the
unprecedented fiscal and monetary global stimulus.”

Lennard Neo, the head of research at Stack Funds, told Cointelegraph
that institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been looking for alternative solutions
not just to provide returns but also to protect their existing portfolio
from further downside risks, explaining:

> “Similar to Grayscale, Stack has seen an uptick in [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ interest
— almost double that figures of pre-crash in March — in Bitcoin […] I
would not say they are ‘gobbling up BTC’ blindly but cautiously seeking
traditional structured solutions that they are familiar with before
making an investment.”

Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, told
Cointelegraph: “We’re seeing increased interest from multiple levels of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s — wealth channels, independent RIAs and institutions.” The
recent BTC halving came at an interesting time — amid the COVID-19
outbreak and the growing unease about quantitative easing. He noted: “It
clearly demonstrated BTC’s scarcity and future supply reduction as
concerns deepened around unprecedented stimulus by the Fed with the
CARES Act.”

Not all are knocking at Bitcoin’s door, though. In a May 27 presentation
to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Goldman Sachs, the storied investment bank, listed five
reasons why cryptocurrencies are not an asset class, which included
Bitcoin, noting: “While hedge funds may find trading cryptocurrencies
appealing because of their high volatility, that allure does not
constitute a viable investment rationale.”

Crypto’s denizens reacted combatively. Referencing the quality of
Goldman Sachs’ recent Bitcoin research, Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss
declared in a tweet: “Today, Wall Street is where you end up when you
can’t make it in crypto” — and he followed up on May 28 with: “Day after
Goldman Sachs says don’t buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is up $500.” Mati
Greenspan of Quantum Economics wrote in his May 27 [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter:
“Regardless of what Goldman Sachs sell-side analysts have to say, it’s
quite clear that institutional interest has been picking up lately.”

On the matter of investment suitability, a recent Bitwise Asset
Management research report made the case for adding Bitcoin to a
diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, noting that on average, “a
2.5% allocation to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would have boosted the three-year cumulative
return of a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio by an astonishing
15.9 percentage points.”

In the roughly two-week period since the BTC rewards halving, which
reduced miners’ block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, 12,337 Bitcoin
were mined as reported by researcher Kevin Rooke on May 27. During that
same period, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust purchased 18,910 Bitcoin — about
1.5 BTC for every Bitcoin created. This has raised some questions about
the overall BTC supply.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on Rooke’s findings in a tweet:
“There isn’t enough new supply to go around, even for just one guy
[i.e., Grayscale].” Greenspan, for his part, told Cointelegraph: “It
seems like institutional players are gradually becoming a much larger
part of this small market.” Might they overwhelm the market? “Whales
have always been an issue,” he opined.
