A retest of $11,500 gives the impression that the bulls are not done
when it comes to Bitcoin, which convincingly bounced off $11,000.
Bitcoin (BTC) rose to fill a significant gap in its price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) on
Aug. 3 as bulls remained in control and took BTC/USD towards $12,000.

Data from price charts including Coin360 showed the largest
cryptocurrency rising once more on Monday, after a correction to
$11,000. Earlier, Monday trading began with a $150 “gap” in Bitcoin
futures markets on CME between $11,450 and $11,600.

As Cointelegraph reported, anticipation immediately built around Bitcoin
rising to fill the void, in line with [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) tendencies over the
past year. Another gap between $9,660 and $9,930 was already in place,
but given the bullish price action of the past two weeks, hopes were
high that the first to be filled would be higher, not lower.

At press time, BTC/USD circled $11,400, having risen to retake the lower
bound of the gap but so far not overcoming resistance at $11,500. The
weekend saw a brief spurt to $12,000 before a sudden correction resulted
in a $1,200 drop within a matter of minutes.
