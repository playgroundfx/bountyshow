Bitcoin hit yet another record high on Friday, and moved within sight of
a market capitalisation of $1 trillion, blithely shrugging off analyst
warnings that it is an “economic side show” and a poor hedge against a
fall in stock prices.

The world’s most popular cryptocurrency jumped 2.6% to an all-time high
of $52,932, setting it on course for a weekly jump of over 8%. It has
surged around 60% so far this month.

Bitcoin’s gains have been fuelled by signs it is winning acceptance
among mainstream [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and companies, from Tesla and Mastercard to
BNY Mellon.

Its latest gains took its market capitalisation - all the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in
circulation - to about $982 billion, according to cryptocurrency data
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) CoinMarketCap, with all digital coins combined worth around $1.6
trillion.

Still, many analysts and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s remain sceptical of the patchily-
regulated and highly volatile digital asset, which is still little used
for commerce.

Analysts at JP Morgan said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s current prices were well above
estimates of fair value. Mainstream adoption increases [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s
correlation with cyclical assets, which rise and fall with economic
changes, in turn reducing benefits of diversifying into crypto, the
investment bank said in a memo.

> “Crypto assets continue to rank as the poorest hedge for major
drawdowns in equities, with questionable diversification benefits at
prices so far above production costs, while correlations with cyclical
assets are rising as crypto ownership is mainstreamed,” JP Morgan said.

Bitcoin is an “economic side show,” it added, calling innovation in
financial technology and the growth of digital platforms into credit and
payments “the real financial transformational story of the COVID-19
era”.

Other [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s this week said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s volatility presents a hurdle
for its ambitions to become a widespread means of payment.

On Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk - whose tweets have fuelled [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s
rally - said owning the digital coin was only a little better than
holding cash. He also defended Tesla’s recent purchase of $1.5 billion
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which ignited mainstream interest in the digital currency.

Bitcoin proponents argue the cryptocurrency is “digital gold” that can
hedge against the risk of inflation sparked by massive central bank and
government stimulus packages designed to counter COVID-19.

Yet [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would need to rise to $146,000 in the long-term for its
market capitalisation to equal total private-sector investment in gold
via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins, according to JP Morgan.

Rival cryptocurrency ether traded down 0.5%, still near a record of
$1,951 reached earlier on Friday. It has been lifted by growing
institutional interest, and after its futures were launched on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
