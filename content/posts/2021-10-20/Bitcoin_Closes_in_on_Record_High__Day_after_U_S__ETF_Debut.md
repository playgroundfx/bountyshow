LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin hovered just below its record highs on
Wednesday and the first U.S. [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures-based exchange-traded fund
([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)) looked set to open firmer after surging on its debut on Tuesday.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency was at $64,257 at 1236 GMT, modestly
higher on the day and within a short jump of the all-time high of
$64,895.22 it hit on April 14 this year.

It reached as high as $64,499 on Tuesday, late in the U.S. session.

Tuesday was the first day of trading for the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) -- a development that market participants say is likely to drive
investment into the digital asset.

The [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) closed up 2.59% at $41.94 on Tuesday, with around $1 billion
worth of shares trading hands on Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s ICE.N
Arca exchange.

It was trading around 0.2% higher before the market opened.

Trading appeared to be dominated by smaller [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and high-frequency
trading firms, analysts said, noting the absence of large block trades
indicated that institutions were likely staying on the sidelines.

James Quinn, managing partner at Q9 Capital, a Hong Kong-based
cryptocurrency private wealth manager, said the launch of the new
product was “meaningful” for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Theoretically, any licensed brokerage firm in the United States which
wants to take on this [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) can do so as easily as any other [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/), which
“should make it available to a lot of folks”, said Quinn.

While the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) is based on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures, Quinn said the trades and
hedges underpinning the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) means activity will flow into the spot
market and the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price.

Crypto [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have launched this year in Canada and Europe amid surging
interest in digital assets. VanEck and Valkyrie are among fund managers
pursuing U.S.-listed [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products, although Invesco on Monday dropped
its plans for a futures-based [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/).

Ether, the world’s no. 2 cryptocurrency, was up 1.5% on the day at
$3,926, near to a six-week high, but some way off its all-time high of
$4,380, hit on May 12.
