Bitcoin was down 0.8% on Tuesday, ending the day near $39,500. On
Wednesday morning, the price stabilized around the $40K level, showing a
slight increase of 0.4% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum added 1.8%
during the same time. Other leading altcoins from the top ten are
showing growth in the range from 0.9% (Avalanche) to 3.7% (Binance
Coin). The Shiba Inu Token (SHIB) has also jumped by 15%, becoming the
growth leader in the TOP-100.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, increased by 1.5% per day to $1.87 trillion. The Bitcoin
Dominance Index fell 0.4% to 40.7% on a sharper rebound in altcoins.

Сrypto market attempts to stabilize after the downturn caused the Fear
and greed index to strengthen. It added 5 points up to 25 by Wednesday
morning and remained in a state of “extreme fear”.

Bitcoin remains the lame duck of the crypto market due to the prevailing
price decline in traditional financial sectors. BTC tried to correct
upwards on Tuesday after a strong drawdown the day before.

According to CoinShares, institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew $134 million
from crypto funds last week, the most in 13 weeks.

In addition, it is still difficult to find confirmation of the
hypothesis that cryptocurrencies are a hedge against inflation. The
latest US consumer inflation data showed an 8.5% rise in prices in the
US. During the same time, the capitalization of the crypto market in
dollars decreased by 13%, reducing the purchasing power of the initial
capital by more than 20%.

Speaking of Germany, for example, with its 7.6% price increase per year,
an 8% depreciation of the euro against the dollar should also be added
to the equation, which will further increase the losses. Investments in
gold, on the other hand, give real (inflation-adjusted) growth of 8%,
and in euros – more than twice as much.

This relationship is critical for retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, most of whom make
decisions based on rather impulsive estimates and proceed from the
foreseeable horizon.

At the same time, the institutional approach still points to the
attractiveness of cryptocurrencies. Bank of America believes that
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could outperform bonds and stocks in
the face of a potential global economic recession.

Investment agency Morningstar believes that cryptocurrencies have no
equal in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of income among assets, although they have too high
volatility.

This is similar to the issue of new assets that the US stock market went
through about a hundred years ago. By the beginning of the new century:
it was the sector of high-tech companies, and now is the turn of
cryptocurrencies.
