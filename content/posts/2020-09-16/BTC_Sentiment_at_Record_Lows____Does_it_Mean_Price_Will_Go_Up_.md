ASocial media sentiment for Bitcoin has slumped to a two-year low, yet
technical indicators are still saying “buy.” A number of metrics
indicate that social and trading sentiment for Bitcoin is still low
despite its price breaking above $11,000 a couple of hours ago.

On-chain analytics provider Santiment has revealed that weighted social
sentiment for Bitcoin is at its lowest level for two years. The metric
takes into account the overall volume of Bitcoin mentions on Twitter and
compares the ratio of positive vs. negative commentary on the platform.

Social sentiment surged a few months ago when Bitcoin started its strong
recovery following the pandemic-induced market crash in mid-March.
However, for most of May, June and July, when the asset was
consolidating in the low $9,000 range, it fell into negative territory
again.

The analytics provider noted that, counterintuitively, negative
sentiment at extremely low levels correlates with price rises, whereas
extreme highs correlate with price retracements.

Bitcoin reached a 2020 high of $12,400 in mid-August, but has failed to
top 2019’s peak of $13,800 leading a number of analysts to assert that
the lower high on the longtime frame indicates that we are not in a bull
market just yet.

Popular charting platform Tradingview also has its own sentiment
indicators for the asset derived from a number of technical indicators.
On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly views, they are flashing buy signals, whereas
things are more neutral on the shorter time frames.

Bitcoin has been largely correlated to stock market movements for much
of this year; however, the “September effect” is a term that has come
about because it is a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly weak month for stock market and
[cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) returns (as Kraken pointed out in its most recent
update). This could be reflected in social sentiment as reported by
Santiment.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was still trading just above $11,000, a
gain of 2.8% on the day and almost 8% on the week.
