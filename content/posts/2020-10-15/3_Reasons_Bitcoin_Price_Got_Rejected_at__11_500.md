The price of Bitcoin rejected $11,500 in a swift price drop alongside
rising shorts on BitMEX and slumping U.S. stocks. The price of Bitcoin
(BTC) rapidly fell after surpassing $11,500 on Binance between Oct. 14
and Oct. 15. Within two hours, it fell to $11,280, recording a 2.3%
drop. After the fall, analysts are expecting another minor pullback in
the near term.

Three factors likely caused the rejection to occur include a sell-off on
BitMEX, a major resistance level and the stock market pullback.

On Oct. 14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 0.58%,
after initially seeing a minor upsurge. As the trend of the U.S. stock
market trend started to shift, Bitcoin recorded a sharp decline. Within
15 minutes, BTC saw a 1.15% drop from $11,518 to $11,370. According to
the data from Skew, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has
increased in recent weeks. In contrast, the realized correlation between
BTC and gold has declined considerably in the last three weeks.

The data suggests that Bitcoin is currently perceived more as a risk-on
asset over a safe-haven asset. Whether that leaves BTC vulnerable for a
pullback amidst a stock market downturn in the fourth quarter remains to
be seen after a strong Q3.

BitMEX sell-off  
Some on-chain analysts spotted a spike in selling pressure coming from
BitMEX, with major market shorts coming through. Before the initial drop
from $11,540 to $11,280 occurred, many multi-million dollar short
contracts appeared on BitMEX.

The $11,500 level has become a resistance area  
The repeated rejection from the $11,500 area has turned it into a
technical resistance level in the short term. Following the struggle of
BTC to break above $11,500, traders have started to ponder the
possibility of a drop below $10,900.

The confluence of repeated rejections from the same resistance level
depicts a weakening short-term trend. But in the upcoming months,
various on-chain data points suggest the likelihood of a strong market
recovery.
