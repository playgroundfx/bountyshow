Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied within $50 of the $11,000 mark after
managing a strong breakout above the $10,500 level. For the past 6
months analysts have kept a laser sharp focus on the key level and many
forecast that Bitcoin price would soar once the multi-year resistance
was obliterated.

Cointelegraph contributor Keith Wareing suggested that Bitcoin price
could rapidly move higher as traders’ sentiment will have grown
increasingly bullish after the long-term resistance level becomes a new
support.

As the 1-hour chart shows, Bitcoin’s recent surge above the long-term
descending trendline from the 2017 all-time high, and today’s move above
$10,500 were fueled by high volume spikes.

At the time of writing, the moving average convergence divergence and
the relative strength index are both in overbought territory, showing
bulls are currently in full control.

Typically and overbought RSI and MACD serve as sell signals but
Bitcoin’s price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) over the years demonstrates that both
oscillators can remain deeply oversold as the price surges to new highs.
