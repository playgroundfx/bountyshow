Intercontinental Exchange subsidiary, Bakkt, is reporting record numbers
of trades for its monthly Bitcoin futures contracts as BTC prices made a
new high for the year. The institutional investing platform reported its
highest ever figure for Bitcoin monthly futures on Jul. 28 with 11,506
contracts — an increase of 85% over the previous record. The move
followed a surge in the underlying asset’s price to a 2020 high of
$11,400.

Bakkt’s physically-settled contracts are paid out in BTC as opposed to
cash-settled contracts that are delivered in USD. The momentum has been
driven by Bitcoin prices which have finally broken out of their two and
a half month range-bound trading channel.

According to data from Skew analytics, Bakkt wasn’t the only
institutional exchange to break records this week. The Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME), which has far greater volumes than Bakkt,
also recorded a surge in Bitcoin futures contracts on Monday. Daily
volume topped $1.3 billion while open interest, a measure of the total
number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled,
also soared to $724 million. According to CME data, 25,493 futures
contracts were traded on Monday, and Tuesday’s preliminary count was
already over 20,900 at the time of writing. Yesterday also saw an uptick
of Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) contracts on CME with over 1,100 traded, the highest
number for the past thirty days.

The two institutional exchanges are small fry compared to the volumes of
BTC futures contracts on [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s. Skew has broken down
the top crypto exchanges in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of 24 hour volume for Bitcoin futures
and Huobi comes out on top with $6.51 billion. OKEx is the second most
popular exchange for BTC futures with a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume of $5.88 billion,
and Binance is a close third with $5.66 billion according to the data.
Skew also reports that aggregated open interest across all exchanges has
also surged to its highest level for a month at $5 billion.
