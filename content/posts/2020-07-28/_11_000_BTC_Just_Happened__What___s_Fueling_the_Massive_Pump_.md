![$11,000 Bitcoin Just Happened: What’s Fueling the Massive Pump?][1]

At its current price point, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has a total market cap of nearly
$205.2 billion. That accounts for 63.1% of the overall crypto market,
which is presently worth almost $327 billion. The rally caught the
attention of mainstream media and casual traders who have grown
accustomed to seeing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rejected in and around the $10,500 mark.
After months of lateral moves, the largest cryptocurrency by market
capitalization is finally breaking out.

Bitcoin is surging at a time when gold–the world’s most trusted haven
asset– is trading at all-time highs against the U.S. dollar. In both
cases, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s appear to be hedging their bets against a shaky
economic recovery–one that could dismantle the stock-market rally over
the medium term. While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) still has a long way to go to prove it’s
an established store of value like bullion, the digital currency
continues to defy the odds with jaw-dropping returns. Despite being
written off in mainstream circles due to its volatility and regulatory
scrutiny, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is up nearly 60% year-to-date. It remains the best-
performing asset of the past decade.

If [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s proponents are correct, the digital currency is about to
enter another bullish cycle–one that could end with 10x returns by the
end of 2021. For that to happen, adoption will have to keep growing in
the face of record central-bank stimulus, ballooning budget deficits,
and worsening economic conditions.
