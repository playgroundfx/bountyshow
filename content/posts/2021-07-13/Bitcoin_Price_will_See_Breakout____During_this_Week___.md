![Bitcoin price will see breakout ‘during this week’ says trader with
$38K target][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) closed beneath a key moving average for the eighth week in
a row this weekend, but one analyst is betting on an imminent breakout.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked Bitcoin as
it reversed weekend gains on Monday after a disappointing weekly close.
The largest cryptocurrency had maintained its familiar trading range
with $33,000 as support through Saturday and Sunday, but the new week
dampened momentum.

For popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital, unless progress can be
made, Bitcoin bulls may not have long to last before fresh losses hit.
“The blue 50-week EMA is still holding as support,” he summarized in a
series of tweets. “If this HL isn’t reclaimed as support soon, the sell-
side pressure on the 50 WEMA may be too much for $BTC to hold here.”

Others were more upbeat. In his latest video update, fellow trader
Michaël van de Poppe went as far as to call a BTC price breakout within
days. “I believe that Bitcoin is going to make a breakout to the
upside,” he forecast. “I would not be surprised if Bitcoin is going to
trade around $38,000 during the days of this week.” A look at buy and
sell levels at major exchange Binance showed resistance forming at
$35,000, with $30,000 remaining in place as overall support.

Altcoins lurk ahead of market decision  
Van de Poppe added that this movement might be good for altcoins, which
could start capitalizing on bullish sentiment. He had previously argued
that altcoins would outperform the speed of Bitcoin’s gains in the
coming months.
