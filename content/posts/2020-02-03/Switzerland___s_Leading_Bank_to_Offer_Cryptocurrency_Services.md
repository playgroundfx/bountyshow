Julius Baer, one of Switzerland's most famous investment company, has
announced recently that it was going to launch various services related
to cryptocurrencies. For this, the well-known bank will be in close
cooperation with newly licensed crypto bank Seba AG, in which Julius
Baer acquired a stake in 2018, having become its minority owner.

Thе Julius Baer’s decision for Switzerland as one of the oldest credit
organizations in the country, whose authority in the global investment
industry is solid enough may be a strong trigger for the rest of the
players from the same sector to have products in line with rivals
services range that allow customers to trade and store cryptocurrencies.

It is important that the partner of Julius Baer, ​​Seba Bank AG, is an
organization whose founders came from another well-known banking
heavyweight, UBS. Recall, Seba Bank AG received permission in August
2019 to trade in securities, as well as a banking license from the main
Swiss financial regulator, FMSA, and now awaits “green light” for
working with crypto assets. For the time being, the services are offered
to customers in Switzerland where Julius Baer uses SEBA’s “cutting-edge
platform and capabilities,” according to the announcement details. After
that, Julius Baer clients will be able to receive cryptocurrency trading
services, as well as custodial services for digital assets. Seba Bank AG
itself already has a special application that supports four
cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Litecoin.

It is worth noting that recently in Switzerland, the attitude towards
the crypto world has begun to change. Firstly, the country's government
is no longer opposing the Facebook project on launching the Libra
cryptocurrency, and officials also intend to deepen work to create a
favorable business climate for the cryptocurrency business, along with
digital services spread all-around-the world.
