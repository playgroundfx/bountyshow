LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Britain set out a detailed plan on Monday to
exploit the potential of cryptoassets and their underlying [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technology to help consumers make payments more efficiently.

As part of creating a global cryptoasset hub, financial services
minister John Glen said Britain will legislate to bring some stablecoins
under the regulatory net such as complying with existing payment rules.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value
relative to traditional currencies, or to a commodity such as gold, to
avoid the volatility that makes [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other digital tokens
impractical for most commerce.

All stablecoins that reference a fiat currency should be regulated, the
government said.

> "The approach will ensure convertibility into fiat currency, at par
and on demand," the finance ministry said, adding that the Bank of
England would regulate "systemic" stablecoins.

Later on this year Britain will consult on creating [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s for a
wider set of cryptoassets like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), taking the sector's energy
consumption into account.

> "If crypto technologies are going to be a big part of the future, then
we in the UK want to be in, and in on the ground floor," Glen told UK
Fintech Week.

>

> "We see enormous potential in crypto and we want to give ourselves
every chance to take maximum advantage."

Britain's "detailed plan" will also develop the potential of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/),
including whether it can be used for issuing British government bonds or
gilts.

> "I don't know the answer but let's find out," Glen said.

ROYAL MINT TOKEN

Regulators globally are trying to grapple with cryptocurrencies, with
the European Union in front with a draft law on crypto markets.

UK finance minister Rishi Sunak has also asked the Royal Mint to create
a non-fungible token which is to be issued by the summer. An NFT is a
digital asset that exists on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), a record of transactions kept
on networked computers.

A regulatory "sandbox" will be launched by the Bank of England and FCA
next year for testing the use of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) in market infrastructure,
Glen said.

The Law Commission will consider the legal status of decentralised
autonomous organisations which use [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), while the implications of
crypto on tax will also be studied, Glen said.

> "On balance, we don't think the tax code will need major surgery to
make it work more easily for crypto," Glen said.

The tax treatment of "defi" loans – where holders of cryptoassets lend
them out for a return - will be assessed.

Britain will also look at removing disincentives for fund managers to
include cryptoassets in their portfolios, he said.
