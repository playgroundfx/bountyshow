At the beginning of the new week, the cryptocurrency index of fear and
greed rose from 48 to 52, remaining within the neutral range.

Bitcoin has corrected down since Thursday along with the decline in
stock indices. Noticeable resistance was provided by the $48K level with
the 200-day moving average passing close to it. Over the weekend, the
first cryptocurrency found a balance near $46K.

Buyers manage to keep [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) from falling to the area of previous peaks
near $45, turning the former resistance into effective support. However,
a breakout of the 200-day moving average is still required to confirm
bullish sentiment. Breaking out of the $45-48K range could signal the
start of a broader trend in the direction of the breakout.

In early April, the commemorative 19 millionth coin was mined in the
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network. At the moment, more than 90% of the total emission of
the first cryptocurrency has been mined, which is limited to 21 million
coins.

Bitcoin can reach $4.8 million if it acquires the status of a global
reserve asset, according to VanEck investment company. However, this
scenario is unlikely. The top contender for the status of world reserve
currency is now the Chinese yuan.
