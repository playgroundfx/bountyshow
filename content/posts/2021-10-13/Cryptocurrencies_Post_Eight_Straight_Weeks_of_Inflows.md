NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency products and funds attracted $226.2
million in investments last week, marking their eighth straight week of
inflows, a report from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on
Tuesday.

Over an eight-week run, total crypto product inflows hit $638 million,
with a year-to-date total of $6.3 billion.

Bitcoin, as expected, led the way, nabbing $225 million, for a fourth
straight week of inflows, according to data in the week ended Oct. 8.

> “We believe the turnaround in sentiment towards [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is due to
constructive statements from SEC chair Gary Gensler, potentially
allowing a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) (exchange traded fund) in the U.S.,” wrote James
Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, in the report.

At a Financial Times conference a few weeks ago, U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Gensler repeated his support for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s that would invest in futures contracts instead of the digital
currency itself.

Bitcoin soared to a five-month high of just under $58,000 on Monday,
boosted by persistent institutional demand as it gains legitimacy among
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. On Tuesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
market value was last down 3.6% at $55,402.

Since a low of $28,600 hit in June, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has gained about 88% of its
value.

Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest research note, said
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) experienced a boost in network activity in the first week of
October, suggesting new demand is beginning to enter in the fourth
quarter.

In addition, Glassnode said the positive sentiment and constructive
price action has also started to creep back into the derivatives markets
amid climbing open interest and rising swap funding rates.

Ethereum, meanwhile, saw minor outflows totaling $14 million, data
showed, as it continues to lose market share to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). Its market
share has fallen 1% to 24% of assets under management in the last week
alone.

Other altcoins such as solana and cardano posted inflows of $12.5
million and $3 million, respectively, data showed. While other digital
tokens, namely polkadot, ripple and [Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/) posted outflows.

Assets under management at Grayscale and Coinshares, the two largest
digital asset managers, climbed last week to $48.4 billion and more than
$5 billion, respectively.
