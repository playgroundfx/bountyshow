HONG KONG (Reuters) - The United States has overtaken China to account
for the largest share of the world’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining, data published on
Wednesday by the UK’s Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance showed.

Chinese authorities banned the activity earlier this year causing miners
to shut up shop or move overseas.

China’s share of the power of computers connected to the global [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
network, known as the “hash rate”, fell to zero by July from 44% in May,
the data showed.

The United States now accounts for the largest share of mining, some
35.4% of the global hash rate as of end-August, followed by Kazakhstan
and Russia, the data showed.
