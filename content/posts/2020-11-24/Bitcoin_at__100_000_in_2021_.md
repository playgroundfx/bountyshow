Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which include top hedge funds and money managers, are
betting the virtual currency could more than quintuple to as high as
$100,000 in a year.

It’s a wager that has drawn eye-rolls from skeptics who believe the
volatile cryptocurrency is a speculative asset rather than a store of
value like gold.

Since January, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has gained 160%, bolstered by strong
institutional demand as well as scarcity as payment companies such as
Square and Paypal buy it on behalf of customers.

Bitcoin is within sight of its all-time peak of just under $20,000 hit
in December 2017. It debuted in 2011 at zero and was last trading at
$18,415.

Going from $18,000 to $100,000 in one year is not a stretch, Brian
Estes, chief investment officer at hedge fund Off the Chain Capital,
said.

> “I have seen [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) go up 10X, 20X, 30X in a year. So going up 5X is
not a big deal.”

Estes predicts [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could hit between $100,000 and $288,000 by
end-2021, based on a model that utilizes the stock-to-flow ratio
measuring the scarcity of commodities like gold. That model, he said,
has a 94% correlation with the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Citi technical analyst Tom Fitzpatrick said in a note last week that
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of next year, citing
its limited supply, ease of movement across borders, and opaque
ownership.

Those numbers though are a head-scratcher for Toronto-based Kevin Muir,
an independent proprietary trader.

> “Any hedge fund model on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is rubbish. You can’t model a mania,”
Muir said. “Is it plausible? For sure. It’s a mania. But does anyone
actually have a clue? Not a chance.”

## DEARTH OF SUPPLY

Bitcoin relies on so-called “mining” computers that validate blocks of
transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10
minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is
rewarded new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s.

Its technology was designed to cut the reward for miners in half every
four years, a move meant to curb inflation. In May, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) went through
a third “halving,” which reduced the rate at which new coins are
created, restricting supply.

That halving has kickstarted [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s renewed ascent.

Square’s Cash App and PayPal, which recently launched a crypto service
to its more than 300 million users, have been scooping up all new
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s, hedge fund Pantera Capital said in its letter to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on
Friday. That has caused a [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) shortage and has driven the rally in
the last few weeks.

## BIG FUNDS BUYING?

The so-called whale index, which counts addresses or wallets holding at
least 1,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s, is at an all-time high, said Phil Bonello,
research director at digital asset manager Grayscale. Bonello said more
than 2,200 addresses were linked to large [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) holders, up 37% from
1,600 in 2018, suggesting that institutional money has stormed in.

Investors like Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of hedge fund Duquesne
Capital, and Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc’s chief investment officer of
global fixed income, have recently touted [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s though are still mostly sidelined due to the pandemic’s
effect on the economy. But with the entry of Square and PayPal, Lennard
Neo, head of research at crypto index fund provider Stack Funds, expects
a deluge of retail demand more intense than in 2017.

Neo forecasts [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to reach $60,000-$80,000 by the end of 2021.

Tempus Inc currency trader Juan Perez was unimpressed, even shocked,
with all the lofty forecasts and said a bet on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at $100,000 next
year would be a bet on the collapse of the global financial system.

> “Governments around the world won’t let that happen. They will not let
fiat currencies collapse just like that,” Perez said.
