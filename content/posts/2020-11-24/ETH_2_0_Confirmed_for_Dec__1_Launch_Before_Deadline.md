ETH 2.0’s beacon chain genesis has been confirmed for Dec. 1, following
the transfer of 524,288 Ether from 16,384 validators into the ETH 2.0
deposit contract since it went live on Nov. 4.

Despite early concerns stemming from low staking participation,
transfers to the deposit contract rapidly increased over the past day —
with more than 200,000 ETH being sent to the contract in the past 14
hours.

ETH 2.0’s beacon chain genesis is now set to take place on the earliest
possible launch date of Dec. 1, with genesis taking place seven days
after the required deposit contract’s threshold was met.

While genesis participants will not be able to withdraw their coins
until ETH 2.0 reaches Phase 1.5 — which will merge the Ethereum mainnet
with ETH 2.0’s beacon chain and sharded environment — many hodlers are
waiting for third-parties to launch withdrawal-enabled staking services,
despite the potential risk of exit scams.

The deposit contract’s threshold was met with roughly nine hours to go
until its deadline.
