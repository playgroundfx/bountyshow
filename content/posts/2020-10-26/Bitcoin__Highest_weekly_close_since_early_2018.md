Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week still at $13,000 and wholly unfazed by
problems in the global economy — what’s in store next Cointelegraph
takes a look at the potential issues at stake for Bitcoin in the coming
days.

Last week’s announcement that payment giant PayPal would support Bitcoin
and three altcoins from 2021 continues to have an impact on price
action. When the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) hit last week, Bitcoin abruptly surged beyond
$12,500 to hit highs of $13,200, subsequently reaching $13,370 over the
weekend. Reactions among veteran Bitcoiners were mixed, with some
warning consumers not to let PayPal hold their cryptocurrency for them,
as restrictions are already known to apply.

Nonetheless, consensus remains that Bitcoin has crossed a major adoption
hurdle.  
At $13,070, Bitcoin sealed its second-highest weekly close since January
2018 on Sunday and its sixth-highest ever. On a technical level, this is
no mean feat — BTC/USD has beaten out long-term weekly resistance at
$11,900 and also held those higher levels. Retaking and holding $12,000
has been notably absent even from Bitcoin’s most successful periods
since the end of its bull market in late 2017, when it reached $20,000.

In both 2019 and earlier in 2020, brief spurts above $12,000 all ended
in rejection and a retreat to lower levels on weekly timeframes. This
week’s close thus provides another turning point for Bitcoin, and
analysts are hopeful that its significance is genuine. Others were more
conservative prior to the event, with Cointelegraph Markets analyst
Michaël van de Poppe eyeing a short-term pullback.

In a further suggestion that Bitcoin may take a breather in the coming
weeks, network fundamentals are showing signs of cooling off after
recent growth. According to data from resources including BTC.com and
Blockchain, difficulty and hash rate are or will be trending down in the
short term. Difficulty, an essential measure of miner activity, is set
for a 1.6% decline at the next automatic readjustment in six days’ time.
Currently, it is at record highs. Estimated weekly average hash rate,
meanwhile, has been sloping downwards from its own highs since Oct. 18.
As of Monday, the average is 133 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the
record standing at 146 EH/s.

For Bitcoin bulls, however, the old adage that price follows hash rate
remains firmly in play.
