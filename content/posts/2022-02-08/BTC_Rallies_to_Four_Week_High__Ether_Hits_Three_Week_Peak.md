NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Bitcoin rose to a four-week high on Monday,
climbing for a second consecutive session, driven in part by liquidation
of some short positions that have accumulated in the virtual currency's
recent three-month downtrend.

The world's largest cryptocurrency hit $44,524.18 , the highest since
mid-January. It was last up 3.8% at $44,024. Since hitting a roughly
six-month low on Jan. 24, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has gained about 35%.

Ether, the second-largest digital currency in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market
capitalization, touched a three-week peak of $3,180 and was last up 3.1%
at $3,153.21. It dropped to a six-month trough in late January, but
since then, ether, the token used for the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), has
surged about 47%.

> "The current rise came after considerable range-bound price action
that saw volumes drying and shorts increasing," said Joe DiPasquale,
chief executive officer at BitBull Capital, which manages crypto hedge
funds.

>

> "Typically, when the market is heavily leaning on one side of a trade,
too long or too short, the price can move to counter that weight and
squeeze positions," he added.

Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest research report on
Monday, said its charts showed that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) shorts have been under
pressure last week, "with a minor skew towards short side liquidations."

But it added that the magnitude of the liquidation remains "fairly
lackluster," suggesting a short-squeeze is just one factor, among many
others, driving the rally in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

The crypto market has been in recovery mode in recent sessions, posting
institutional inflows of $85 million last week, marking the third week
of inflows totaling $133 million, according to a report from digital
asset manager CoinShares released on Monday.

Bitcoin led all inflows, with $71 million, the largest since early
December and the third straight week of inflows, with a total of $108
million. For the year, however, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) posted net outflows of $60
million.

Ether, on the other hand, posted net outflows of $8.5 million in the
week ended Feb. 4, its 9th straight week of outflows, totaling $280
million. That represents 2.2% of assets under management, according to
CoinShares.
