On Monday, Bitcoin rose 5.5%, ending the day around $44,100. Ethereum
added 5%, and other leading altcoins from the top ten also showed
growing dynamics: from 4% (Solana) to 18.5% (XRP).

The total capitalization of the crypto market increased by 5.5% over the
day to $2.10 trillion. The Bitcoin dominance index has not changed,
remaining at 39.2%. The Bitcoin chart continues to paint a bullish
picture. With the price at $45K on Tuesday morning, BTCUSD is trading
above the 50-day moving average just above the mid-January pivot area
and above the down channel resistance level. At the same time, the RSI
on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts has not yet entered the overbought area, leaving
room for further growth.

The same can be said about the entire cryptocurrency market, where the
fear and greed index has reached a neutral point of 48 and is still far
from the greed area. The next target for the bulls looks to be $48K, the
December support area in December. Further targets are $49-50K, where
the 200-day moving average and significant round level are concentrated.

The XRP token soared amid reports of a significant approach to the
resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).

Cryptocurrencies briefly stopped responding to movements in US stock
indices, which started the week with a decline. The purchases probably
included retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, who were driven by the desire not to miss the
beginning of the market growth (FOMO). However, their buying potential
is unlikely to be enough if stock indicators intensify their decline and
large institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s come into play, wishing to resume profit-
taking.

KPMG, one of the world’s largest auditors, has added Bitcoin and
Ethereum to its Canadian division’s corporate reserves. This is the
firm’s first direct investment in cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, at the end of 2021, Tesla received a loss of $ 101 million
from a decrease in the cost of previously purchased [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s, which it
spent $ 1.5 billion on. Previously, Elon Musk called the decision to
acquire BTC as a reserve asset quite risky.
