SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore state [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Temasek Holdings has
joined the Facebook-backed Libra digital currency project which has
faced intense scrutiny from global regulators worried its launch could
erode national control over money.

The entry of Temasek, which latest figures show has a portfolio value of
just over S$300 billion ($210 billion), was announced by the
Switzerland-based Libra Association, the entity managing the digital
currency project, late Thursday.

Temasek becomes one the project’s most prominent backers after payments
giants Mastercard, Visa Inc and PayPal earlier ditched the scheme.

Libra, which also added cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Paradigm and private
equity firm Slow Ventures to its roster, said Temasek offered a
“differentiated position” as an Asia-focused [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).

In a separate statement, deputy CEO of Temasek International, Chia Song
Hwee, said: “Blockchain technology can play a transformative role in
payments networks by enhancing cost efficiencies, creating new business
opportunities and accelerating financial inclusion.”

> “Our participation in the Libra Association as a member will allow us
to contribute towards a regulated global network for cost effective
retail payments,” he said.

The prospect of Facebook’s 2.5 billion users adopting Libra has led to
intense scrutiny from global regulators.

In April, Libra’s governing body said the planned digital currency will
be linked to individual national currencies and overseen by global
watchdogs, in a scaled-back revamp it hopes will win regulatory
approval.

Libra is now expected to be launched between mid-November and the end of
the year, later than initial plans for a launch by the end of June.

Earlier this month, Libra appointed HSBC legal chief Stuart Levey as its
CEO.
