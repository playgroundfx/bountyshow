More than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) has now been tokenized to
access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum (ETH)
network. That’s equivalent to the entire total value locked (TVL) in
DeFi less than four months ago. According to DeFi Pulse, roughly 98,300
BTC, worth $1.05 billion, has been tokenized using protocols other than
Blockstream’s Lightning Network — equating to more than 12% of the
DeFi’s sector’s $8.57 billion combined capitalization.

The milestone illustrates the increasing popularity of ETH-based
protocols for generating passive returns among Bitcoin hodlers, with the
entire DeFi sector having been valued at just $1.05 billion TVL as of
the start of June — of which $47.5 million or 4.7% was Bitcoin,
indicating that the share of DeFi’s capitalization represented by BTC
has increased by 150% over three and a half months.

By contrast, the Lightning Network has only attracted 1,100 Bitcoin
worth $11.5 million since launching during March 2018. While both
protocols have more than doubled in the number of locked Bitcoin over 30
days, WBTC continues to attract a larger volume of BTC than Ren — with
WBTC growing from roughly 28,360 BTC to 56,850 BTC, and RenBTC expanding
from 10,000 BTC to 21,510 over one month.

Over the past 90 days, both projects have grown by more than 850%. On
June 19 WBTC represented only 5,839 BTC and Ren had tokenized just 155
BTC.

In June, the vast majority of BTC in the DeFi sector took the form of
Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), However, the launch of Ren’s more decentralized
Virtual Machine (VM) and RenBTC in addition to grassroots tokenization
protocols like PieDAO’s BTC this year have boosted Bitcoin’s expansion
into DeFi.

Bitcoin tokenization protocols let users lock up their Bitcoin and mint
an corresponding ERC-20 token — allowing the value represented by a
user’s Bitcoin holding to interact with [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s on the Ethereum
network.
