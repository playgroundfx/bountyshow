Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has appeared largely unfazed, despite this array
of seemingly unfavorable stories. This could be indicative of upside
potential in the coming weeks, according to a report Monday from crypto
investment solution company CoinShares. “It tells me holders are not
nervous and leverage is low — a theory supported by wallet activity and
traffic — and skews my short term price expectations from neutral to
positive,” wrote Danny Masters, executive chairman of CoinShares.

> “In my 30 years in trading my top golden rule was to act when the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
was not matched by price movement,” Masters wrote. “Having been around
crypto during MtGox, the China ban, Bitfinex Hack, Trump comments and
many of the other market-smashing stories that punctuate [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) I was struck by the lack of negative price movement,
particularly around BitMEX,” Masters added after noting the FCA and
BitMEX events as recent, potentially bearish happenings.

Bitcoin has gained a number of large mainstream participants in the past
several months, partly in an effort to preserve these speculators’
capital against inflation. Masters details these mainstream entrants in
the first part of the report, mentioning Square and MicroStrategy as two
examples. MicroStrategy allocated $425 million of its treasury reserves
to Bitcoin between August and September. Square picked up roughly $50
million in Bitcoin at the beginning of October.

> “We think these actions are but the beginning of a treasury
diversification strategy which will appeal to technology and payments
companies around the globe,” Masters wrote. Earlier in the year,
billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones placed his own heavy bet
on Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.
