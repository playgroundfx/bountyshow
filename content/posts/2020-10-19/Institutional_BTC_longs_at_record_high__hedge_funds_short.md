According to CME, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) long contracts held by
institutions are at an all-time high. Yet, CME’s most recent Commitment
of Trader report shows hedge funds are at a record-high for BTC shorts.
There seemingly is a major difference in the perception of Bitcoin’s
short to medium-term trend between hedge funds and institutions.

Hedge funds typically implement varying strategies to generate returns
for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Oftentimes, hedge funds will utilize derivatives and
employ a more high-risk strategy. In contrast, institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
who are allocating a percentage of their portfolio to Bitcoin likely
have a long-term strategy. This means they are not concerned about the
short to medium-term performance of BTC.

Some analysts say that hedge funds are likely short on Bitcoin to
provide liquidity to institutions longing the top cryptocurrency. When
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s increasingly build up their long positions,
there need to be sellers on CME to balance the order book. Mitchell
Nicholson, a cryptocurrency analyst, said: “Many HFs are likely shorting
CME futures hedged to capture the basis or providing liquidity to the
institutions going long.”

Technically, hedge funds might also be shorting Bitcoin after repeated
rejections of a key resistance level. Bitcoin has been unable to break
out of the $11,700 to $12,000 resistance range since August. For over
two months, Bitcoin has been mostly ranging between $10,500 to $11,700,
struggling to show upside momentum.

After BTC’s recovery from $3,600, hedge funds may be expecting a
significant pullback.

On Oct. 17, Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale, said the firm reached
all-time high assets under management (AUM) at $6.4 billion. The figure
from Grayscale is critical to measure institutional activity because
their products mainly tailors institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. In the U.S.,
there is not a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)) approved by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, institutions rely on
the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which operates more like an exchange-traded
product (ETP) to gain exposure to Bitcoin.
