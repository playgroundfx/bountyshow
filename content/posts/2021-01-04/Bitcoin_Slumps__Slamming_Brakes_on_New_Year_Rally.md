Bitcoin fell sharply on Monday, losing ground from a record high of
$34,800 touched a day earlier, with traders citing volatility in highly
leveraged futures markets.

Bitcoin fell more than 14% after earlier touching as high as $33,670,
wiping out more than half its 20% rally from New Year’s Eve to a record
$34,800 on Sunday.

Bitcoin was last down 8% at $30,542.

A functioning cryptocurrency derivatives market has developed since
2017, with offshore exchanges still offering highly leveraged trading.
Moves in such markets can have an outsized effect on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price.

> “It’s the unwinding of some of that leverage,” said Richard Galvin of
crypto fund Digital Asset Capital Management.

Bitcoin’s record high came less than three weeks after it crossed
$20,000 for the first time, on Dec. 16. The world’s biggest
cryptocurrency more than quadrupled in price last year.

Traders said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s drop on Monday was not unusual for the volatile
asset, whose wild price swings have in part prevented it from becoming
widely used as a currency.

> “It’s still an unavoidably volatile asset by its nature,” said Joseph
Edwards of crypto brokerage Enigma Securities.

>

> “For the most part, this looks like a purely technical move, signalled
and caused by short-term euphoria,” he added.

Smaller coins that often move in tandem with [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) also fell, though
not as sharply. Ethereum, the second biggest, dropped 1% after touching
a 3-year high of $1,170.

Fuelling [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rally has been the perception it can act as a hedge
against the risk of inflation as governments and central banks turn on
the stimulus taps to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.

> “Some of it is reflecting the fear of a weaker dollar,” Bank of
Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim said of its most recent rally.

Still, gold rose 2%, underlining [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s patchy correlation with the
traditional inflation hedge.

Bitcoin’s advance has also reflected expectations it will become a
mainstream payment method. Its potential for quick gains has also
attracted demand from larger U.S. [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
