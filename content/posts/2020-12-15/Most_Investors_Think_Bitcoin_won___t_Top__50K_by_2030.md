A survey from Genesis Mining has found that most Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
aren’t expecting a $50,000 BTC price in 2030 — although 3.5% of
respondents tipped prices exceeding $500,000.

![Most Investors Think Bitcoin won’t Top $50K by 2030][1]

British Virgin Islands-based institutional mining platform, Genesis
Mining, has published the findings from a survey of 1,000 current and
former U.S.-based Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s — two-thirds of whom believe BTC is
a better long-term store of value than the dollar.

More than half of respondents believe Bitcoin will beat out gold, real
estate, and the stock market over the five to 10 years, with 65%
expressing faith that BTC’s value will continue to appreciate with time.

The bear case  
But despite the apparently favorable sentiment, just 17% of those
surveyed predicted that Bitcoin’s price would exceed $50,000 by 2030.
This would only require the price to increase by 160% over the next 10
years, while BTC has already gained 166.5% during 2020 so far.

A further 17% predicted that Bitcoin’s price would actually fall over
the next decade, while one sixth of respondents did not feel confident
in speculating on BTC’s long-term price performance.

In total 50.1% of respondents estimated that BTC will be worth $20,000
or less by 2030, one third predicted the price will be $10,000 or less,
and 11.8% forecasted prices below $1,001.

Almost one-third of respondents who predict a stagnate or bearish
10-year performance expect Bitcoin to be hindered by [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, while
one fifth anticipate outright bans on cryptocurrency from governments.

Roughly 17% of non-bullish respondents expect another cryptocurrency or
a central-bank issued digital currency will capture a dominant market
share and supersede BTC, while 16% predict Bitcoin’s [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) meteoric
hype-cycles will die down over time. Nearly 10% of participants do not
believe “there is going to be a practical use case” for Bitcoin in
future.

On the bullish end of the spectrum, one-tenth tipped Bitcoin would be
worth six-figures or more in a decade, with half of them expecting
prices exceeding $500,000.

The survey had a good mix of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, with one quarter allocating more
than half their wealth to virtual currency investments, one quarter had
crypto exposure of between 10% to 50%, another quarter had between 1%
and 10% in crypto, while the rest had 1% or less of their wealth
currently in virtual currency.

A recent survey from fund manager Grayscale Investments found that the
COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on Bitcoin sentiment, with 39%
of respondents describing BTC as “more appealing” amid the pandemic.

Last month, a survey of 700 high-net-worth individuals published by
deVere Group found that 73% of millionaires either already own or are
planning to invest in crypto assets by 2023.
