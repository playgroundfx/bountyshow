Bitcoin rose 0.6% on Tuesday, ending the day around $38,700. Ethereum
added 3.7%, while other leading altcoins in the top 10 are growing: from
0.5% (Binance Coin) to 12.8% (Solana). The total capitalisation of the
crypto market, according to CoinGecko, rose 1.5% to $1.86 trillion
overnight.

Bitcoin hit a week-and-a-half high above $39,000 on Tuesday but then
pulled back, offsetting almost all of the gains. The first
cryptocurrency was boosted by positive stock indexes and a weakening
dollar, but sellers began taking profits on long positions.

Over the last eight days, BTC gained almost 20%, recouping more than
half of the failure of the second half of January, and buyers decided
not to take risks. Ahead is solid psychological resistance at the
circular $40,000 level, which supported the first half of January.

Technically, Bitcoin has stalled its gains as it approaches the upper
boundary of the descending channel. Traders are waiting for new signals
about whether the recovery in risk demand will continue or whether the
latest rebound will soon be choked off. The result of this struggle will
determine whether we will see a break from the downtrend or whether the
downtrend will continue again.

El Salvador president Nayib Bukele is confident that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will still
show tremendous growth. It’s all about the fact that there are 50
million millionaires in the world. If they wanted to buy a coin, there
wouldn’t be enough for everyone, as the entire [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) issue wouldn’t
exceed 21 million.

MicroStrategy added another 660 BTC on the recent market decline. In
total, MicroStrategy already has more than 125,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s. Russian
government officials told Bloomberg that Russians own $214 billion worth
of cryptocurrencies. That’s about 12% of the total crypto market
capitalisation.
