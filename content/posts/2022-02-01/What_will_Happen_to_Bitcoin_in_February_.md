Bitcoin rose 2.1% on the last day of January, ending the day at around
$38,500. Ethereum added 4.3%, while other leading altcoins in the top 10
strengthened between 0.5% (XRP) and 9.2% (Terra). The total
capitalisation of the crypto market, according to CoinGecko, rose 2.8%
to $1.83 trillion overnight.

![What will Happen to Bitcoin in February?][1]

Bitcoinâ€™s rise came amid a rebound in stock indices and a weakening
dollar. The S&P 500 index of the U.S. broad market tested highs for a
week and a half but lost 5.3 per cent in January. The past month was the
worst for the S&P 500 since the crisis in March 2020.

The high-tech Nasdaq fell even further in January, by 9%. Bitcoin has
been particularly strongly correlated with the index lately.

Bitcoin lost about 17% in January, declining for the third month in a
row. Meanwhile, February is seen as a more successful month for the
first cryptocurrency in [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data.

Over the past 11 years, BTC has strengthened on eight occasions and only
declined on three. The average gain over the eight years was 31%. If
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) shows a similar rise in February, it will end the month just
above the $50,000 round mark.

On a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) basis, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has rarely declined for more than three
months in a row. There have only been three such instances: in 2011,
2014 and during the crypto-winter in 2018. All this increases the
chances of a BTC rebound in February.

On the chart, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) remains within a down channel, but thanks to the
rebound, it has made it to the upper end of the corridor over the past
week. A consolidation above 39,000 would be the first signal of a trend
break, while the ability to develop a rise above 40,000 could instil
even more confidence in buyers.
