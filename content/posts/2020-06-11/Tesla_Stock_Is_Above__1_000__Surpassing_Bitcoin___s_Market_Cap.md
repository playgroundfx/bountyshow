Today the value of Tesla stock set a new record high at $1,027, bringing
the market capitalization to $188 billion, and also surpassing the total
market cap of Bitcoin (BTC), which hovers at $181 billion.

While the value of Tesla stock and Bitcoin price are not interconnected,
there is a symbolic comparison between the two as the same [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) FOMO
which drove several Bitcoin rallies in the past appears to be present in
the stock market.

![Tesla Stock Soars Above $1,000, Surpassing Bitcoin’s Market Cap][1]

Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to move forward with the
release of an autonomous semi-trailer truck and analysts speculate that
this decision is partially fueling the stock’s rally.

While the hype surrounding the semi truck may have played a part in
driving Tesla price upwards today, the entire stock market has been on
an uptrend throughout the past week.

The Nasdaq, an exchange dominated by FAANG stocks including Microsoft,
Apple, and Microsoft, is also continuing its rally above its record
high. Despite the abrupt coronavirus-driven 37% plunge of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DJIA) in March, the Nasdaq is up more than 10% year-
to-date.

The retail frenzy around the stock market has become so intense that
professional traders say they have never seen anything close to it in
the past several decades.

Bitcoin, in contrast, has not seen nearly as much retail demand since
May. The top-ranked digital asset saw a strong uptrend from March to
April as the price of BTC rebounded from $3,600 to $8,000 and eventually
topped out at $10,440.

However, the noticeable shift in retail demand for risk-on assets like
Bitcoin to stocks raises uncertainty around BTC in the short to medium-
term.

As retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the U.S. predominantly focus on stocks, traders
question where the next demand source for Bitcoin will come from. Based
on Bitcoin’s price trend in the last six months, the most likely source
of demand in the near-term are institutions.

According to Fidelity, more than one third of institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in
the U.S. are invested in either Bitcoin or Ether.

Combine this with the record high inflow of institutional funds into
Graycale’s publicly-traded Bitcoin investment vehicle and one could
conclude that institutions may lead the next Bitcoin rally.
