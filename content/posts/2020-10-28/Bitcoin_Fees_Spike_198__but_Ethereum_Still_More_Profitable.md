Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees have nearly tripled in three days, from
$3.52 to $10.20 on average. According to crypto market data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)
Glassnode, 22.25% of Bitcoin miners’ income is currently made up of
fees, with the other 77.75% coming from block rewards. The share of fee
revenues is currently the highest it has been since the plateau of the
last all-time high in January 2018 — which followed fee revenues spiking
to almost a 45% share during the previous month.

The latest spike follows a jump in average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Bitcoin fees in recent
days, launching into double-figures in dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) for the only time
except for the period between November 2017 and January 2018.

Despite the share of mining revenue represented by fees tripling in the
past month for Bitcoin miners, Ethereum (ETH) miners are still raking in
more fees. Ethereum fees recently outpaced those generated by Bitcoin
for the longest streak ever, owing to stablecoin use and the exploding
decentralized finance (DeFi) sector built on the Ethereum network.

After first overtaking Bitcoin on June 6, Ethereum’s fee revenue
exceeded Bitcoin’s until Oct. 22, with two momentary exceptions at the
end of July and the start of August.

While Bitcoin momentarily reclaimed its fee dominance last week,
Ethereum’s fees have again been higher since Oct. 25. As of this
writing, Ethereum fees totaled $1.74 million over the past 24 hours,
compared to Bitcoin’s $1.54 million, according to Messari.
