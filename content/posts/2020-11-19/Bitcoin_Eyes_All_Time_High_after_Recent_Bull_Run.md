Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is back in a big way in 2020. The cryptocurrency has
rallied almost 150% so far this year, including a gain of 70% over the
last few weeks. Bitcoin is now at its highest level against the dollar
in three years and analysts are starting to wonder if it could reach new
all-time highs. “The door is still wide open for the digital currency to
challenge its all-time,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at
Avatrade.

Bitcoin reached a record high of $19,783.06 (£14,946.40) on 1 January
2017 — just before the bubble burst and the price rapidly fell back to
trade near $3,500. Since then, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has struggled to hold above
$10,000 — that is, until this year. The cryptocurrency began creeping
higher over the summer before rapidly rising from October onwards. On
Wednesday, the cryptocurrency briefly rose above $18,000 for the first
time since 2017.

The bull run has caught many analysts by surprise. “What’s remarkable
this time is the lack of hype around Bitcoin,” said Neil Wilson, chief
market analyst at Markets.com. Media coverage and Google searches are
nowhere near levels seen in 2016 and 2017 when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices rapidly
spiralled higher.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has likely helped fuel at least some of
the rally. Many evangelists argue [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a safe haven asset akin to
gold. JP Morgan (JPM) said in a note last month there is a generational
divide, with millennials preferring [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and older [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s opting
for gold. Still, the majority of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s gains have come in the last
few weeks even as positive vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has emerged.

PayPal (PYPL) recently backed [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) too. At the start of October, the
company said it would allow customers to buy and hold crypto through its
app. JP Morgan called the endorsement a “big step” for the market. And
traditional financial players are increasingly getting in on the market.
Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones bought [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in May as a hedge
against inflation, one of the highest-profile endorsements from a
traditional money manager.

In combination, these factors have helped put [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on a tear. The
bull run could well continue into 2021 — although if 2017 is anything to
go by, prices could crash rapidly once [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) peaks. The price fell on
Thursday morning — down 2.6% to $17,399 — but the all-time high remains
in sight.
