Bitcoin (BTC) can hit $100,000 in five years and $1 million by 2035,
Nugget’s News CEO Alex Saunders has told Cointelegraph. Speaking in an
interview with Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe on
Nov. 18, Saunders described current conditions as a “perfect backdrop”
for new highs.

> “It’s either going to keep going like right now in the next few weeks
and get to $20,000 very quickly, or it’s going to have its bit of a
range now and then hopefully positive into next year,” he said.

Saunders was speaking as BTC/USD came off recent highs of $18,400 to
move in a wide corridor, which has become focused on $17,700. Gains have
been swift, with weekly performance alone delivering up to 15% returns.

Looking ahead, Saunders believed that six or seven figures for Bitcoin
lay some way off, but that a combination of money and adoption meant
that there was now “no way out.” “I honestly think that Bitcoin will hit
$100,000 in the next five years, and then it’s going to become about,
‘Well do they actually try and shut it down, or how do they regulate it
and trade it?’” he told Van de Poppe.

> “And if it’s allowed to just continue on its mission and absorb all
the money from around the world and become a global reserve currency… I
think we can get to $1 million per coin in the next, whatever that is,
15 years.” The estimates appear somewhat conservative by comparison to
some extant price forecasts, among them, the popular stock-to-flow based
series, which predicts at least $100,000 by next year.

Saunders’ concerns about legality in the event of major price rises echo
those of major [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Ray Dalio, whose comments on Bitcoin earned him
significant publicity this week.
