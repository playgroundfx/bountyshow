Bitcoin is trading above $43K on Thursday morning, gaining 2.5% over the
past 24 hours. For the last ten days, we have seen a systematic increase
in prices, although with a very modest amplitude by the standards of the
crypto market.

Ethereum adds 3.4%, while other leading altcoins from the top ten add in
the range from 1% (XRP) to 12% (Dogecoin).  
According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market grew by 2.8% over the day, to $1.96 trillion. The Bitcoin
Dominance Index lost another 0.2% to 41.7%.

The crypto-currency index of fear and greed has grown by 9 points over
the past day, to 40. This is still a zone of fear, but already close to
neutral territory.

Bitcoin retreated from the resistance at $43K on Tuesday, but on
Thursday it is again making attempts to gain a foothold above this mark.
The last rollback in this case could be nothing more than a tactical
retreat of the bulls in order to develop growth with renewed vigor.
However, confidence in the formation of a strong bullish momentum will
come only after BTCUSD fixes above 45 thousand, from where we saw
reversals in February and early March.

Moderate but steady optimism around [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is the best breeding ground
for altcoin buyers. It is clearly seen that their dynamics are now
better than that of the first cryptocurrency. If this trend continues
for a couple more days, the effect of a feedback loop may work, when the
outstripping growth of altcoins will pull Bitcoin up.

Bank of America predicts that [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of the cryptocurrency market
will increase confidence and increase its capitalization by 15 times, up
to $30 trillion.

The former head of one of the divisions of Bank of America, David Woo,
believes that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will face economic and geopolitical pressure after
the launch of the state digital currency (CBDC) of the United States.
China has already acted in a similar way, which has come closest to the
introduction of the digital yuan.

Thailand will ban the usage of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment
from April 1st. They declared that such payments have a negative impact
on the financial system and reduce the effectiveness of the stateâ€™s
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
