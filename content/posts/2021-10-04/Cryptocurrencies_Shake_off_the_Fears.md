Bitcoin starts the week at $48K, maintaining a positive outlook after a
spike over the weekend. The price momentum pushed the first
cryptocurrency up to $49K over the weekend, with other coins following
Bitcoin upward. After reaching local highs, a cautious sell-off began.
However, judging by current high prices, optimism in the market prevails
over pessimism.

The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed
the $2 trillion thresholds, amounting to $2.1 trillion as of this
writing. The first cryptocurrency capitalization is approaching $900
billion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and major
cryptocurrencies jumped from last week to 54, which corresponds to a
“neutral” mode, fully reflecting what is happening in the crypto market.
As recently as last week, the sector was in “fear” mode.

Bitcoin remains the locomotive of the crypto market, and now all crypto
market participants will be watching the prospects of overcoming the
circular level of $50K very closely. Even an unsuccessful attempt to
overcome it will be very positively perceived by all market
participants. If the coin manages to consolidate higher, we can count on
the appearance of a new impulse of demand. In this situation, even a
sideways price trend can be positive, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s increasingly see that
the absence of price fluctuations does not always mean that a sale is
coming.

The neutral position of US regulators can make a significant
contribution to the growth of crypto. Head of the Federal Reserve,
Jerome Powell, said that there are no plans to ban cryptocurrencies, but
some coins need [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/). In this case, we are likely talking about
stable cryptocurrencies, which “parasitize” on the US dollar. Bitcoin’s
volatility and relatively small capitalization size (compared to the
traditional market) so far give it protection from regulatory pressure.

China, meanwhile, bans access to crypto information resources, including
CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Beijing has consistently restricted its
citizens’ access to cryptocurrencies. In this case, though, it is worth
noting that the Chinese firewall will only keep the laziest away from
this information. The VPN in the digital age is becoming one of the
paramount applications on any device. In addition, not all crypto-
exchanges and other resources are KYC compliant, so the Chinese may well
continue to use cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government’s actions could
make it more difficult, expensive, and dangerous for its citizens to use
cryptocurrencies.

The authorities of Western countries probably understand the reality, so
we will not see similar bans from the US and the EU. However, there is
no doubt that the authorities of developed economies have several main
tasks in the crypto sector: maximum tax collection and avoiding
competition with the dollar or euro. Now the cryptocurrency market is
entering its most active phase right up to Christmas and the New Year.
If digital currencies continue to grow, we can see how much patience
regulators have. Cryptocurrencies are not a priority for regulators
right now, so [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will likely have time to make the most of the
sector.
