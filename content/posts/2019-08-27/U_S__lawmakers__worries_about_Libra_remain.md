Maxine Waters issued a solemn declaration recently in which it was noted
that the Congressional delegation met with a number of Swiss authorities
representatives, including SIF (State Secretariat for International
Financial Matters), the FDPIC (Federal Data Protection and Information
Commissioner), the FINMA (Financial Market Supervisory Authority) and
Swiss legislators to understand the rank, diversity and scope of
Facebook's plans.

Libra project should thoroughly investigate the issue of a tech giant to

Waters was a known critic of  Libra's project since its first
announcement and after a while, she confirmed that Congress will
continue to eye the development of this cryptocurrency project.

Recall, Waters managed even to call for a “moratorium” on Libra’s
development in the course of a TV appearance on CNBC.
