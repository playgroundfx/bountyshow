As of Wednesday, the mean fee per transaction, or the average
transaction cost, was 0.00086764 BTC (BTC, 1.09%), the highest since
June 2018, according to data source Glassnode. In dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), the
average transaction fee was $11.66. Average fees in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) have

Price Rally][1]

> “Bitcoin mempool [memory pool] is back in focus in the wake of rising
transaction volumes, causing congestion in the network and consequently
driving fees higher,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-
based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk.

Mempool is the collection of unconfirmed transactions. When [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
transactions are executed, they are first sent to the mempool, where
they wait for approval by miners. Bitcoin miners can process only 1
megabyte (MB) worth of transactions per block mined roughly every 10
minutes.

When the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) experiences a rise in traffic, it causes delays and
a backlog of transactions. As demand outstrips supply, miners increase
their revenue by prioritizing transactions with higher fees. That, in
turn, forces other users to offer higher fees to avoid long waiting
times.

Network congestion is usually seen during price rallies. As noted
earlier, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has chalked out a significant rise over the past 12
days. During that time frame, network congestion, as measured by the
total number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, worsened by
1,800%.

As of Tuesday, there were 121,340 unconfirmed transactions in the
mempool with a total block size of 66.8 MB. According to data source
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).com, that’s the highest level since the bull market frenzy of
December 2018.

Hashrate drop contributes to congestion  
The recent slide in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s hashrate looks to have played a big role
in causing network congestion along with a general price-driven pickup
in activity. In other words, the mining power dedicated to approving
transactions and mining blocks has gone down amid the price rally,
boosting waiting times and network congestion. The seven-day moving
average of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s hashrate has declined from 146 exahashes per second
(EH/s) to 120 EH/s.
