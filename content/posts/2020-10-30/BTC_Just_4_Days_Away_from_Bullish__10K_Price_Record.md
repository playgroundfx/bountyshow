Bitcoin (BTC) has spent nearly 100 days above $10,000 — and if [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
repeats itself, further price gains could be astronomical. As noted by
various social media users this week, as of Oct. 30, Bitcoin was just
five days away from trading above $10,000 for 100 days.

According to data from analytics firm CoinMetrics compiled by Twitter
user Julio Moreno, after trading above certain price points specifically
for 100 days, Bitcoin subsequently gained by an order of magnitude. For
example, after staying above $10 for 100 days, it took just 122 days for
BTC/USD to reach $100. After cracking 100 days above $100, meanwhile,
$1,000 appeared in just two days.

Looking at the difference between $1,000 and $10,000, the time period
was longer — 150 days to crack five figures after trading at four
figures for 100 days. “Bitcoin has held above $10,000 for over 90 days
now, currently ~30% higher than this key level. This is the longest
period in its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),” analytics resource The TIE reported as part of
the latest edition of its Weekly Insights [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)letter on Monday.

> “The second longest period was back in December of 2017 when BTC
surpassed $10,000 for the first time, just days before it increased by
79% to set it’s all-time high of $20,000. Third was in August of 2019,
when Bitcoin traded within a 20% range for nearly 4 months.”

Nov. 3 meanwhile also forms the date of the 2020 U.S. presidential
elections, an event whose outcome is widely tipped to have an immediate
impact on macro markets. Tuesday will also see a difficulty readjustment
for Bitcoin, currently estimated at 10.4% down, the largest such
downward move since late March. As Cointelegraph reported, the result
should be an easier entry level for miners, with a rebound following.
Price action may be influenced in line with miner behavior, while
current high fees should also reduce as mining becomes more profitable.
These are currently at their most expensive in U.S. dollar [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) since
early 2018.
