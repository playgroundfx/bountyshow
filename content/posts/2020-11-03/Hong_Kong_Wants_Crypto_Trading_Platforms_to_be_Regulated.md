HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will regulate all cryptocurrency trading
platforms operating in the financial hub, the city’s markets watchdog
said on Tuesday, changing its previous “opt in” approach.

Financial regulators around the world are still assessing whether and
how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Investor
protection and preventing money laundering are particular concerns.

Other financial centres in Asia such as Japan and Singapore have
licensing regimes which require all cryptocurrency trading platforms to
be regulated.

In contrast, while Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)
launched a regulatory framework specifically for cryptocurrency trading
platforms last year, this was restricted to those platforms that traded
an asset officially classed as a security or future, not just tokens
like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

> “This is a significant limitation, as under the current legislative
framework if a platform operator is really determined to operate
completely off the regulatory radar it can do so simply by ensuring that
its traded crypto assets are not within the legal definition of a
security,” Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, said in a speech on
Tuesday.

Consequently, the Hong Kong government, today, will propose a new
licensing regime today under its anti-money laundering legislation,
requiring all cryptocurrency trading platforms that operate there, or
target [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the city, to apply for an SFC licence, Alder said.

Dozens of [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s operate in Hong Kong, including some
of the world’s largest, though many chose not to apply for a licence
under the existing regime.

The SFC has not issued a full licence to any exchange, but has agreed in
principle to issue a licence to cryptocurrency firm OSL Digital
Securities, a unit of Fidelity-backed BC group, OSL said in August.
