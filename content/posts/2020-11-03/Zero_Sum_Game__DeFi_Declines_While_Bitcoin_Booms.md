The co-founder of crypto data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Markets Science, Twitter-user
‘Bitdealer,’ has shared a chart indicating negative correlations between
11 top DeFi tokens and BTC over the past 45 days to Nov.1, with AAVE
showing neutral correlation and UNI showing confluence if less than 0.1.

Seven of 13 DeFi tokens were also found to have negative correlations
with Ethereum (ETH), despite Ethereum powering much of the DeFi
ecosystem. With many decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens struggling
while Bitcoin (BTC) surged in price this week, analysts have identified
a longer negative correlation between DeFi tokens and BTC.

However, the sector found its speculative plateau by the end of August,
with Binance’s DEFI Composite Index crashing 64% from $1,100 at the
start of September to less than $400 as of this writing. TokenSet’s DeFi
Pulse Index (DPI) has also shed more than half its value since launching
at $130 in mid-September. DPI tokens last traded hands for just $61.55.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has increased by more than one-third in the
past month, rallying to tag $14,000 at the end of October after global
payments giant PayPal announced it was entering the crypto sector.

Trade activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) also appears to have
reversed, with monthly DEX volume falling from close to $26.3 billion in
September to roughly $19.4 billion last month. Only a handful of DEXs
have a significant share of the sector’s volume, with Uniswap and Curve
representing 75% of decentralized trade in September. The past three
months’ worth of Uniswap volume equates t45% of total DEX volume since
November 2019.
