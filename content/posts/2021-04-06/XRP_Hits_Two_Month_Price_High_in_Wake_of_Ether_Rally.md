XRP, the cryptocurrency used in Ripple Labs’ payments network, is
rallying on the coattails of altcoin leader ether (ETH, 1.15%)‘s recent
move to record highs. XRP rose to $0.72 early Monday to hit the highest
level since Feb. 2 and was last seen changing hands near $0.70. The
third-largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained 18% in the past
24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The price rise comes three days after the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s ether
token set new lifetime highs near $2,100. Since then, the second-largest
coin has established a foothold above $2,000, helping XRP and few other
alternative cryptocurrencies such as tron (TRX, 20.47%), stellar (XLM,
17.28%), orchid (OXT, 23.37%), [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cash (BCH, 9.99%), and eos (
12.06%) score gains amid the dull action in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 1.17%) – the
crypto market leader.

> “We’re not seeing anything specific to XRP and the move feels more
like an altcoin season type move given outperformance in other tokens as
well,” Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.
Names like TRON and siacoin (SC, 18.11%) “are performing even better
than XRP on this more thinly traded Easter holiday Monday.”

With a move to two-month highs, XRP has now completely reversed losses
suffered in December after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) filed a case against Ripple for raising $1.3 billion by selling
XRP in unregistered securities offerings. Ripple executives’ attorney
James K Filan tweeted on Saturday that Ripple and the SEC have reached
an agreement to keep the payment company’s two of the four private email
correspondences from being scrutinized under the ongoing lawsuit. So
far, analysts are not sure if that’s powering XRP higher.
