![Ethereum price can gain 40% on Bitcoin, argues analyst as London fork
nears][1]

Ether (ETH) could rise by almost 40% against Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming
trading sessions, according to one analyst. So believes Michaël van de
Poppe, an Amsterdam-based market analyst who predicts that the ETH/BTC
exchange rate will climb from its current 0.05–0.06 BTC range to as high
as 0.07 BTC soon.

The technical chartist based his bullish analogy on the pair’s support
level at 0.063 BTC. The price floor was instrumental in maintaining
ETH/BTC’s bullish bias during the mid-May 2021 notorious crypto market
crash. It also served as solid support during the pair’s uptrend in the
early May 2020 trading session.

The bullish analogy appeared right as ETH/BTC stretched its price
rebound, from its June 27 low of 0.0552 BTC, by 21.28%. It showed that
more traders preferred to sell their Bitcoin holdings to seek
opportunities in the Ether market in recent days. On a year-to-date
timeframe, the second-largest cryptocurrency had already surged by more
than 160% against Bitcoin.

The transition took cues from the euphoria surrounding Ethereum’s
planned consensus layer transition from its energy-intensive proof-of-
work (PoW) to a more scalable and cheaper proof-of-stake (PoS). The
project launched the first phase, called Phase 0 or Beacon Chain, in
December 2020. It introduced a so-called sharded network architecture to
the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)

The next phase that brings Ethereum closer to PoS is the Ethereum
improvement Proposal 1559, also known as the London hard fork. The
upgrade proposes to replace Ethereum’s “first-price auction” fee model
with a base network fee, modifiable per the network’s demand. It hopes
to solve the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s higher gas and transaction fee problem. It
also aims to make ETH a deflationary token by burning the base network
fee.
