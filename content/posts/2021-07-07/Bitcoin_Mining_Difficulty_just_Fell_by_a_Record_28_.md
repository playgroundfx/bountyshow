![Bitcoin mining difficulty just fell by a record 28% — But will this
help BTC price recover?][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded its biggest mining difficulty drop of nearly
28% on July 3, but one model suggests that the BTC price will not bottom
until October. In a series of tweets on July 2, investment manager
Timothy Peterson flagged the relationship between Bitcoin price and hash
rate as arguable evidence that the dip is not over.

Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped by an estimated 27.94% on Saturday at
block height 689,472, the biggest in its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). As Cointelegraph
previously explained, the drop is in response to the ongoing miner
migration out of China and the subsequent loss of hash rate. For miners
still at work, the decrease will be something of a profit boost —
difficulty automatically accounts for changes in hash rate, making it
more attractive to mine when it drops.

Miners in flux are not expected to return to their craft completely for
several months. In that time, difficulty will likely increase again as
hash rate goes up — more competition and more power competing for the
same set reward. It is a classic mantra among Bitcoiners that “price
follows hash rate” — but if that is true, one model charting the
phenomenon is painting a sobering picture of future price behavior.
Peterson noted that the relationship between price and hash rate is
“useful” when it comes to marking macro price tops.
