NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volatility in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) eased on Wednesday, a day
after El Salvador adopted the crypto asset as legal tender, but the
threat of a U.S. lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc
underscored the rocky road ahead for cryptocurrencies.

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Coinbase with a Wells
notice, indicating the U.S. regulator will sue if the crypto exchange
goes ahead with the launch of its interest-bearing “Lend” product for
crypto assets.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has called the crypto universe a “Wild West” that
is riddled with [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) risk.

Coinbase said it would delay the launch until at least October. Shares
of Coinbase closed down 3.2% at $258.20.

Coinbase is not the only cryptocurrency platform to come under
regulatory scrutiny. Several states have cracked down on BlockFi.

It would be a mistake to view the SEC’s scrutiny as isolated to
Coinbase, which happens to be in the spotlight, said Cowen & Co, a unit
of financial services firm Cowen Inc, in a note to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

> “This is part of a broader regulatory pushback on crypto,” said
analyst Jaret Seiberg. “As we have long argued, crypto should expect to
be regulated the same as the traditional product it is trying to
replicate or replace.”

Trading in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was less hectic after the cryptocurrency suffered its
heaviest losses in 2-1/2 months on Tuesday, when it hit a near four-
month high of $52,956 before ending the day down 11.1%, its largest
percentage drop since June 2.

At one point on Tuesday, the digital currency fell as much as 18.6%,
wiping out more than $180 billion in market value.

Bitcoin slid 1.64% to $46,095.97.

While a historic day for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as El Salvador became the first country
to make the digital currency legal tender, Tuesday proved a bumpy start.

Technological glitches hampered its use while street protests by
mistrustful citizens broke out in the Central American country.

Analysts said the move by El Salvador showed crypto currencies are here
to stay but as with any innovation, they will suffer birthing pains as
the currency’s volatility must be resolved.

Bitcoin has been pitched to a largely unbanked population in El Salvador
as an effective savings vehicle and a store of value for users, said
Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at Warwick
Business School in Britain.

> “High volatility in a medium of exchange corresponds to high
volatility in the macroeconomy. Users who hold [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) will now see wild
swings in their savings,” Viswanath-Natraj said.

Bitcoin has experienced [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading moves of 10% or more 10 times this
year, as it did both in 2020 and 2019, according to Refinitiv data. In
2018 and 2017, there were 17 days each year of 10% moves or more, per
Refinitiv.

Citing volatility in crypto markets, Robinhood Markets Inc said on
Wednesday it would roll out crypto recurring investments, allowing
customers to buy digital coins commission-free and with as little as $1
on a schedule of their choice.
