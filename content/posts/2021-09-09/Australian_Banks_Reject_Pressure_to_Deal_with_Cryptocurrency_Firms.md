SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two of Australia’s largest lenders, National
Australia Bank (NAB) and Westpac, on Thursday rejected criticism that
they are stymieing competition by refusing to do business with
cryptocurrency providers.

Many of Australia’s top financial institutions have not engaged with the
sector, despite its huge growth in the past year, due to its high risks.

The stock exchange ASX Ltd, similarly has not allowed cryptocurrency-
related listings, forcing some firms to seek public listings overseas,
including on the Nasdaq.

> “It’s one of the emerging issues that we are looking at - what should
our relationship be, if at all, with cryptocurrency,” NAB Chief
Executive Ross McEwan told a regular parliamentary hearing.

The bank did not have a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) excluding crypto-related customers, but
did not service any of them and would only do so if it was profitable
and the bank could tolerate the risks, McEwan said.

> “We have to look at where does cryptocurrency go, along with ... the
reserve bank and regulators. And what’s the risk inside the bank of
dealing with cryptocurrency providers as well.”

Peter King, the chief executive of Westpac, the country’s second-largest
lender, said the anonymity of cryptocurrency made it “very hard” to meet
the bank’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing
requirements.

Local digital currency exchanges Bitcoin Babe Pty Ltd and Aus Merchant
Pty Ltd on Wednesday told a parliamentary committee exploring [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
regulate the sector that none of the Big Four banks would do business
with them.

Singapore-based payments and remittances firm Nium on Wednesday also
said that Australia had been the only country where it had been “de-
banked”, out of 40 where it operates.

> “Today, fintechs are always one decision away by the banks from
closing their businesses,” Nium APAC head of consumer Michael Minassian
said. “It’s time to cast an appropriate light on this anti-competitive
practice.”
