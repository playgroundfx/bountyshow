(Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a six-month high on Friday, approaching the
record hit in April, as traders became increasingly confident that U.S.
regulators would approve the launch of an exchange-traded fund based on
its futures contracts.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency rose nearly 4% to as high as $59,664,
its highest since mid-April. It has doubled in value this year and is
near April’s record high of $64,895.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to allow the
first U.S. [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) to begin trading next week, Bloomberg
News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy at Asia-based cryptocurrency
exchange AAX, said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s spike above $59,000 wasn’t arbitrary and
long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had been accumulating it for a while.

> “It is widely expected that Q4 will see significant progress around a
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) in the U.S.,” he said.

Friday’s moves were also spurred by a tweet from the SEC’s [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
education office, he said.

> "Before investing in a fund that holds Bitcoin futures contracts, make
sure you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits," the SEC
tweet stated.

Cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been waiting for [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of approval of the
country’s first [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/), and some of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rally in recent
months has been in anticipation of that move and how it could speed up
its mainstream adoption and trading.

Several fund managers, including the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, ProShares,
Invesco, Valkyrie and Galaxy Digital Funds have applied to launch
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s in the United States. Cryptocurrency [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have been
launched this year in Canada and Europe.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously said the crypto market involves
many tokens which may be unregistered securities and leaves prices open
to manipulation and millions of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s vulnerable to risks.

The Bloomberg report said that the proposals by ProShares and Invesco
are based on futures contracts and were filed under [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) rules
that Gensler has said provide “significant [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) protections”.

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the
Bloomberg report.
