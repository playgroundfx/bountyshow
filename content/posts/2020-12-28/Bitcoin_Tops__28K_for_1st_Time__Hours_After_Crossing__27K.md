Recently, BTC has been leaving a string of broken records in its wake
after passing the psychologically key $20,000 mark for the first time on
Dec. 16. In the last several days BTC seems to found yet another gear,
breaking through $25,000 Friday night for the first time, and going
through $26,000 Saturday afternoon like a hot poker through one-ply
tissue.

Roughly half a day later, BTC surged past $27,000 early Sunday morning,
before racing past $28,000 just before dawn, before settling down to
$27,604.67 at this writing, up 9.63% in the last 24 hours. Year-to-date,
BTC is up more than 275%. In the last 48 hours, it’s risen 14%. With a
market value of $512.34 billion, BTC is now more valuable than all but
seven publicly traded companies, sitting between Alibaba at $545.4
billion and Tencent Holdings at $509.7 billion, according to Statista
data.

Institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are perceived to be driving this record-setting
run. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($25 million in
December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to
10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  
With the end of the year looming, some fund managers may also be buying
BTC so they can brag next year about being smart enough to get in in
2020 while neglecting to say at which price they had done so.

In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks,
has been printing money with abandon trying to stave off the worst
economic effects of the pandemic, while U.S. President Donald Trump has
been pushing Congress to pass an even bigger relief package to allow for
larger stimulus checks. These actions are viewed by many as potential
catalysts for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could
be positive for BTC.

While the tremendous rise in BTC might make it easy to think we’re going
to see $30,000 before the end of the year, it’s good to keep in mind
that this surge is taking place over a holiday weekend on thin volume.
Monday could well bring a different narrative.
