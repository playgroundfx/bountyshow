As the Bitcoin (BTC) price is reaching the highest levels since January
2018, Bitcoin mining is getting more profitable due to a number of
factors. According to data from Blockchain.com, BTC miners revenue has
soared to levels not seen since Bitcoin’s third halving in May 2020 that
reduced the miner block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

As such, BTC miners’ revenue hit $20.8 million on Nov. 4. According to
Blockchain.com, the highest point recorded since September 2019, when
miners’ block reward was twice as much as now. A spike in BTC miner
revenue levels is coming from Bitcoin price doubling since the May
halving. On Nov. 4, Bitcoin price reached a new 2020 high at $15,950,
jumping more than 20% over the past seven days.

The jump is also due to the simultaneous rise in Bitcoin transactions’
fees. As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin transaction fees surged
nearly 200% in late October. As such, the percentage of BTC miner
revenue from fees has significantly increased, accounting for $4.15
million or roughly 20% of total miner revenue.

Amid parabolic growth in revenues, some miners are likely to start
cashing out at this point. According to analysts at CryptoQuant, some
miners may be compelled to start selling BTC since the Miner’s Position
Index is currently at around 4. Values above 2 indicate that most miners
are selling.

Additionally, there is also a noticeable spike in transactions from
miners to exchanges as the price crossed above $15,000. However, the
amount is still relatively small compared to pre-halving outflow levels.
