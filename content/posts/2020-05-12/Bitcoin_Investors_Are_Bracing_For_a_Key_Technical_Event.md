Bitcoin faces a key technical event Monday known as the “halving.” Due
to take place later in the day, industry insiders are debating what
effect it might have on the cryptocurrency market.

So what is the halving? You can think of it as an update to the
underlying network that logs all [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) transactions. There are so-
called “miners” on this network with specialized computing rigs
competing to solve complex math problems to validate [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
transactions. Whoever wins that race gets rewarded in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

On Monday, the amount of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s rewarded to those miners is set to get
cut in half. This is something that takes place roughly every four years
to keep a lid on inflation. The current reward stands at 12.5 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s,
or BTC, so that will now be reduced to 6.25 BTC.

Unlike fiat currencies like the dollar, there is no central bank that
manages the supply of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) or its inflation rate. Instead, this is
maintained thanks to a rule written into [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s code by pseudonymous
inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.

The total number of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s that will ever be mined is capped at 21
million. Rewards to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miners keep halving until they reach zero.
Bitcoin bulls say that this scarcity is part of what underpins the
cryptocurrency’s value and make it a potential “hedge” against
currencies that are vulnerable to devaluation in times of economic
crisis.

How could prices react?  
Investors are likely to closely watch the reaction of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other
[cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s to the halving event later in the day. Some
believe the event has been mostly priced into markets already, but there
are others who think it could boost prices.

The past two halvings led to opposite short-term price movements,
according to British [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange CoinCorner. Bitcoin climbed 7% one
month on from the first halving event in 2012, but slipped 10% a month
after the second one in 2016. However, the price rose 944% six months on
from the 2012 halving and 38% in the same period in 2016.

> “While many anticipate bullish movements post-halving, we believe the
supply shock that comes immediately after the halving event should have
limited impact on price in the short term,” Lennard Neo, head of
research at Singapore-based [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) index fund provider Stack, said in a
note Thursday. “As the block reward for miners decreases, there will be
a time lag as miners (supply side) reposition towards market
equilibrium.”

> “We anticipate that it could take 6-9 months before this equilibrium
is found and Bitcoin realises halving-induced price appreciation. That
said, further turmoil in the broader economies could accelerate its
upward trajectory.”

But there are also fears that the 2020 halving will also have an impact
on miners’ earnings, as they’ll need more competitive mining gear to win
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rewards.

> “Miners currently need to produce more work to get the same reward,”
said Ed Hindi, CIO at Cayman Islands-based cryptocurrency hedge fund Tyr
Capital. “Post halving their expected returns will be cut in half.”

Bitcoin has risen more than 20% since the start of the year. The virtual
currency, known for its volatility, suffered at sharp drop over the
weekend. It briefly touched $10,000 on Friday but has since declined to
around $8,800 as of Monday morning.
