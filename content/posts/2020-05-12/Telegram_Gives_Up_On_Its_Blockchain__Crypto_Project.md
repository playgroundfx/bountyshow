Rest in peace GRAM coin, we hardly knew ye.

No, seriously. TON was the next big cryptocurrency project attached to
one of the biggest messaging apps in the world — Telegram — run by Pavel
Durov, the expat Russian holed up somewhere between the Caribbean and
Dubai after self-exiling from Moscow.

Durov said on his Telegram channel today that the two and a half year
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and crypto project has been put to sleep.

Ironically, after leaving Russia because the government wanted his
encryption keys to his social media firm, Durov’s cryptocurrency idea
lost steam because of a U.S. court.

> “The technology we created allowed for an open, free, decentralized
exchange of value and ideas. TON had the potential to revolutionize how
people store and transfer funds and information,” he wrote on his
channel. “Unfortunately, a U.S. court stopped TON from happening.”

New York’s Southern District court declared that GRAM couldn’t be
distributed in the United States. The judge ruled that U.S. citizens
might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched, so
the platform couldn’t be allowed either. Keeping the project alive would
be difficult now because it meant a legal headache for Durov to make
sure no Americans would ever be involved in transactions on the
platform.

Today marks the last day for Telegram’s active involvement with TON. No
present or past member of Telegram is involved with any TON projects out
there. Some networks based on the technology may appear, they won’t have
any affiliation with Telegram, Durov told his channel followers.

TON Labs, a startup that had been running a test network, launched its
own version of the network last week, dubbed “Free TON,” after Telegram
announced further delays, Coindesk reported today.
