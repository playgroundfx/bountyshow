Yesterday, we saw a 5% decline in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price below the $7,000 support
area against the US Dollar. BTC even broke the $6,800 support level and
the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded as low as $6,761 and it
is currently consolidating losses. There was a break above the 23.6% Fib
retracement level of the downward move from the $7,295 high to $6,761
low.

An initial resistance on the upside is seen near the $6,955 level (the
recent breakdown zone). The first major resistance is near the $7,000
and $7,030 levels. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with
resistance near $7,030 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

The trend line coincides with the 100 hourly simple moving average at
$7,035. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from
the $7,295 high to $6,761 low is near the $7,028 level. If there is an
upside correction, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) bulls are likely to struggle near the $7,000
and $7,030 levels. A successful close above the trend line, the 100
hourly SMA and $7,050 could open the doors for a fresh increase. The
next key hurdle above $7,050 is near the $7,200 level.

Technical indicators:  
Hourly MACD – The MACD is currently losing momentum in the bullish zone.  
Hourly RSI ([Relative Strength Index](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/relative-strength-index.html)) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near
the 50 level.  
Major Support Levels – $6,750 followed by $6,555.  
Major Resistance Levels – $6,960, $7,030 and $7,200.
