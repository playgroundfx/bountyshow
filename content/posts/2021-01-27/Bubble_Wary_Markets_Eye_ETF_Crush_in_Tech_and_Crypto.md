Is the presumed proliferation of market bubbles just speculative froth
among amateur traders or is concentrated institutional money blowing big
soapy spheres that interconnect and may inevitably burst each other?

The two factors are certainly at play as savings balloon amid massive
government and central bank support for confined populations during the
pandemic.

Over-caffeinated day traders with whizzy new stock market apps and
punting from bedrooms during lockdown get most blame for some of
blinding single stock surges of the past six months.

The parabolic price surges include seemingly unrelated booms in anything
from carmaker Tesla to cryptocurrency Bitcoin, Big Tech ‘disrupters’ or
barely profitable internet startups.

Few doubt the combination of pandemic confinement, job furloughs,
windfall savings and low-cost trading platforms all speak loudly to the
phenomenon.

But the buzz around some active themed funds in the mushrooming Exchange
Traded Fund space is just as eye-catching and perhaps raises bigger
questions about concentrated risk.

A ballooning of the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) world since the last great crash is the first
obvious point - as they were only bit players in the Great Financial
Crisis of 2008. The number of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s captured by fund tracker Lipper has
risen almost five-fold since 2009 to some 5,582 worldwide last year -
with combined assets of almost $6 trillion compared with less than $900
billion 11 years ago.

Refinitiv data shows the combined [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) and wider Exchange Traded Products
category topped $7 trillion last year - about 8% of total world equity
market capitalisation.

And to the extent that [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have traditionally been passive index
trackers, growth of the sector over those years has appeared pretty
benign. Their attraction stems largely from their pitch as low-cost
vehicles channelling savings and 401(k) pension money into broadly
diversified portfolios and which only disrupt the pricier end of the
active management business.

What’s more, long-standing fears of potential accidents with [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
exchange sourcing and pricing of underlying assets and adequate cash
balances during market stress have proven mostly unfounded to date
during market wobbles of the past decade.

But as the years rolled on and virtually every index on the planet was
shadowed by multiple [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, questions about new [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) and
ideas were increasingly met with the response: “There’s an [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) for
that”.

Far from simple and passive index trackers, a blizzard of themed and
leveraged [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s has emerged - charging higher fees for targeted
outperformance or demanded by professional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for hedging
purposes.

A report by Citi this week shows thematic [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s came into their own last
year, with a $57 billion surge in flows bringing total assets to some
$140 billion, and it reckoned this growth was “still in its early
stages”.

And perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tech boom and ongoing lockdowns,
it shows “disruptive innovators” and “clean energy” funds have driven
the trend and that’s where the concentration of new inflows and assets
lie.

For some analysts, the swelling of these types of funds goes a way to
explaining recent outsize and sometimes correlated market moves hitting
the headlines - and could cause serious headaches if just one part of
them were to go into reverse.

## TWO BY TWO

For example, four of the 10 best performing non-leveraged [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s over the
past year were themed funds managed by ARK Invest - with its flagship
Ark Innovation and Ark Next Generation Internet generating year-on-year
returns of between 750-850%. Assets under management have hit more than
$24 billion and $6 billion respectively, compared with less that $2
billion and $500 million each just a year ago.

What’s in those funds is more interesting. Unlike many wider index
trackers, they are concentrated in little over 50 stocks, with Tesla
making up about 10% in each and the Next Generation Internet [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) also
including crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as its fifth largest
holding alongside the likes of TV streaming firm Roku and online health
firm Teladoc.

Citing a recent analysis in Barron’s magazine examining difficulties for
open-ended [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s like ARK’s hitting capacity limits in relatively
illiquid stocks due to enormous inflows, Saxo Bank strategist Peter
Garnry warned of spillovers in any sharp reversals in its holdings.

> “We are basically putting out the warning this interconnectedness of
positions could drive each other and become the epicenter of the next
correction in growth equities,” he wrote. “Our thinking is that a sell-
off in Bitcoin can cause risk adverse behaviour among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with
Tesla-Bitcoin-Ark positions and suddenly a vicious sell-off has
started”.

Whether themed [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s are prone to bunching relatively small stocks that
have seen sharp price rises and these then attract waves of inflows
looking to ape past performance that merely blow bubbles in the process
is a question.

Citi notes this problem. “We are cognizant of a ‘which comes first’
dilemma, the theme or the underlying stock price action?”

And on that, recent studies aren’t kind.

An academic paper by Itzhak Ben-David, Francesco Franzoni, Byungwook Kim
and Rabih Moussawi published by the National Bureau of Economic Research
this week studied [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s over the 20 years before the pandemic and
concluded that what they call ‘specialized’ [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s performed poorly.

> “These [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s tend to hold attention-grabbing and overvalued stocks and
therefore underperform significantly. They deliver a negative alpha of
about −4% a year,” it said, adding that under-performance persists for
at least five years following launch - usually the peak of excitement
around the investment theme.

Perhaps it’s different since the pandemic.
