A proposal by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
that would require crypto exchanges to collect personal information,
including names and home addresses, from individuals seeking to transfer
cryptocurrencies into their own wallets is poorly defined and could have
widespread repercussions, say a number of regulatory experts.

The proposed rule, unveiled last Friday, would require crypto exchanges
to collect this personal information from customers who transfer an
aggregate of $3,000 per day to “unhosted” wallets (which are also
referred to by FinCEN as self-hosted or self-custodied wallets; crypto
users may know them as private wallets or, simply, wallets). Transfers
of over $10,000 per day would require the exchange to file a Currency
Transaction Report (CTR) to FinCEN, reporting these transactions and the
individuals making them to the federal government.

The proposed rulemaking, which was published in the Federal Register on
Dec. 23, has quickly drawn widespread industry backlash, with complaints
ranging from the document’s poorly defined [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) to the rushed process
itself. Comments are due by Jan. 4, cutting what would normally be a
months-long public comment period to just two weeks.

The controversial rule is said to be a personal project of Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC stablecoin
co-issuer Circle. It originally was thought to be far more stringent
than the final version published last week.

Further, it appears the rule is being jammed through the rulemaking
process to ensure it is implemented before President-elect Joe Biden
takes office next month, said Nick Neuman, CEO of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) self-storage
firm Casa.

The shortened comment period reduces how much time exchanges have to
determine whether they need to change their internal processes to remain
in compliance, said Amy Davine Kim, chief [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) officer of the Chamber
of Digital Commerce advocacy group. How exchanges would comply also
remains an open question, she said.

‘Breaking’ DeFi  
The rule itself is unlikely to impact end users, said Neuman. While
there were initially rumors that Treasury’s proposed rulemaking would be
far more stringent – potentially going so far as to ban unhosted wallets
outright – this would have been far more difficult to implement.

> “What isn’t clear is how the regulated service providers like
exchanges will be actually implementing this,” he said. “There’s going
to be compliance necessary if the rule passes among exchanges, brokers,
other custodians, they’re going to have to implement this in one way or
another and how they implement this will be important to what the user
experience is like.”

Exchanges might need to whitelist individual wallet addresses to ensure
funds aren’t sent to a wallet without the required personal information,
he said.

One area that does seem likely to be impacted is decentralized finance
(DeFi). Multiple people told CoinDesk the proposed rule’s biggest – and
most unclear – impact would be on DeFi projects.

For one thing, many DeFi projects rely on [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s to store or
escrow funds. Users engage with, say, Compound by connecting their
MetaMask wallet to the lending platform. Subsequent transactions are
reflected in the wallet itself, and unique to the user’s holdings.

Plus, these [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)-powered platforms don’t have physical
addresses, nor are they necessarily operating under the auspices of an
actual company. In short, Uniswap would persist if Uniswap’s founders
were arrested. It is unclear how such DeFi platforms would be treated
under FinCEN’s proposed rule.
