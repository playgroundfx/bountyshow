Bitcoin (BTC) kept the volatility coming on Dec. 23 as a dive to $22,800
sparked a lightning-fast rally to classic $24,000 resistance. Data from
Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as
factors including panic among XRP traders made unstable conditions
prevail. At press time, the pair was circling $23,700 after briefly
heading above sell levels at $24,000. All this happened in the same few
hours, which saw Bitcoin go from current levels to $22,800 in a matter
of minutes and back again.

With volatility firmly evident, attention turned to the prospects for
altcoins as problems at Ripple sent BTC dominance soaring to one-year
highs. “Historically, we’ve been making a top structure in December,
after which we had a wonderful first quarter for altcoins,”
Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe commented to Twitter
followers on Bitcoin dominance action.

Meanwhile, the biggest XRP holder, Ripple, is facing a new lawsuit from
U.S. regulators over potential sales of unlicensed securities. Should
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) win its case, analysts
worry that XRP trading will be effectively destroyed due to the legal
ramifications.

Earlier today, Cointelegraph noted that a major stockpiling effort from
institutional giant Grayscale failed to buoy market mood after the
company added $285 million in BTC to its assets under management on
Tuesday.
