What happens when a cryptocurrency once positioned as a regulator-
friendly alternative to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) gets heat from regulators? Exchanges
that trade XRP are about to find out.

![Coinbase ‘Between Rock and Hard Place’ on Delisting XRP][1]

U.S.-based [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s have to consider whether to delist
XRP in light of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit
alleging it is an unregistered security issued by Ripple Labs to raise
funds.

Chief among these exchanges is Coinbase, which, in addition to the
normal considerations around listing XRP, is also seeking SEC approval
to take its shares public and allow retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to trade them. If
the SEC prevails in its lawsuit, XRP may be classified as a security,
meaning under U.S. law entities offering it for trading must register as
securities exchanges.

It’s also possible an SEC victory would destroy XRP’s value because the
regulator wants to prevent Ripple from selling any more tokens, and for
Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen to disgorge
their profits, pay prejudgement interest and pay civil penalties.

While some exchanges, market makers and funds have already begun
delisting XRP or exiting positions and transactions with the
cryptocurrency, it may not be a black-and-white question for larger
exchanges.

Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at law firm Seward & Kissel LLP, told
CoinDesk that trading platforms like Coinbase “are between a rock and a
hard place.”

> “They can continue to list XRP based on their previous analysis that
XRP is not a security, with the hope that a court will find that XRP is
not a security,” he said. “Or they can take ‘remedial’ actions such as
restricting trading for wallets held by U.S. persons, or take it off
their exchange altogether.”

These scenarios are likely already covered by the exchanges’ [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
service policies, he said.

Exchanges like Coinbase would “be crazy not to consider” delisting, said
Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo LLP.
Considering the question isn’t the same as actually delisting – or not
delisting – the cryptocurrency, however.

> “They have to think – including just from a business perspective but
also legal – what kind of precedent they’re setting,” he said. “If they
delist one [cryptocurrency] just because a regulator accuses it of being
a security, what happens the next time that happens? Have you just given
the SEC the right to delist anything from your platform just because [it
makes] an accusation?”

Delisting digital assets on that basis may not be great for the
exchange’s customers, said Shapiro.

> “It’s not an easy decision for [Coinbase] to just delist and,
personally, if I were them I don’t think I would delist unless I had
something more concrete to point to,” he said.
