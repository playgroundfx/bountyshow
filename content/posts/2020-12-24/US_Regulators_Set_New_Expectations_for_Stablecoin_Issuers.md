A group of leading U.S. financial regulators has released a new
statement on stablecoins. One of the headlining topics of crypto
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) this year, stablecoins were the main topic of a Dec. 23
statement the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, or PWG.
The PWG includes representation from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve,
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.

The group’s stated opinions were hardly revolutionary, mostly saying
that stablecoin issuers would need to abide by all the typical rules of
the road in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of financial law. The regulators say that stablecoins
need to have systems in place to abide by all applicable anti-money
laundering requirements before coming to market.

Morever, the regulators did not say that stablecoins are necessarily
currencies or commodities, which are subject to less aggressive
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) than securities or derivatives. They instead left the
question open:

> “Depending on its design and other factors, a stablecoin may
constitute a security, commodity, or derivative subject to the U.S.
federal securities, commodity, and/or derivatives laws.”

The announcement quotes Treasury Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich as
saying, “The statement reflects a commitment to both promote the
important benefits of innovation and to achieve critical objectives
related to national security and financial stability.”
