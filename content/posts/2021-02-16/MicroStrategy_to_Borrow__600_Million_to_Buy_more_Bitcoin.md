Major [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) corporate backer MicroStrategy will borrow $600 million to
buy more of the currency, it said on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency
surged past $50,000 in value.

Shares of MicroStrategy, the world’s largest publicly traded business
intelligence company, rose more than 4% on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), adding to their
meteoric 580% surge in the past year.

The company, whose Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor has become one
of the most vocal proponents of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), spent last year steadily
amassing more of the currency after making its first investment in
August.

MicroStrategy said last week that it views its [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) coffers as long-
term holdings and does not plan to regularly trade in the currency or to
hedge or enter into derivative contracts.

MicroStrategy owns close to 72,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), a regulatory filing showed
on Feb. 2, valuing its [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) holdings at about $3.6 billion, according
to a Reuters calculation.

Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc provoked a new round of hype around the currency
earlier this month by revealing it had purchased $1.5 billion of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), adding to a handful of U.S. companies holding it on their
balance sheets.

MicroStrategy also sold notes worth $650 million in December to buy
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the general public due to their speculative nature and
potential for money laundering.

However, major firms such as asset manager BlackRock Inc, credit card
giant Mastercard Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal, have
backed certain cryptocurrencies in recent weeks.

BNY Mellon last week said it formed a new unit to help clients hold,
transfer, and issue digital assets.
