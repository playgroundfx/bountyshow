Bitcoin hit a new record high $60 shy of $50,000 on Tuesday, extending a
sharp rally that has been mostly fuelled by big [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s beginning to
take digital assets seriously.

The first and most famous cryptocurrency, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) hit $49,938 and has
gained roughly 70% this year, most of that after electric carmaker Tesla
said it bought $1.5 billion in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and would accept the currency as
payment.

Tesla’s move was the latest in a string of large investments that have
vaulted [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) from the fringes of finance to company balance sheets
and Wall Street dealing desks, as U.S. firms and traditional money
managers have started to buy a lot of it.

The soaring cryptocurrency, which was near worthless a decade ago when
software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s for two pizzas,
surpassed $20,000 only in mid-December, but has so far struggled to
crack $50,000 after a few attempts.

> “Bitcoin has been range bound for the past four or five days,
suggesting either stalling momentum or a consolidation period,” said
Justin d’Anethan, sales manager at digital asset company Diginex in Hong
Kong.

>

> “We believe in the latter,” he said, since strong recent demand has
been drawing down [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s finite supply.

Bitcoin last traded just short of its new record at $49,045 while rival
cryptocurrency [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) also held near its own record top of $1,879 made
last week.

Besides Tesla, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has drawn unprecedented flows from big and small
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in recent months and posted new milestones on the path to
greater takeup as a mode of exchange.

The cryptocurrency was created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose
real identity is unknown and is based on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology which
acts like public ledger of transactions. It began circulating in 2009,
mostly among speculators - something which is beginning to change.

Business software firm MicroStrategy made the first of several
multimillion-dollar [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) purchases in August and a number of Wall
Street fund managers, such as billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, now
sound positive on the asset.

PayPal is allowing customers to use [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at its merchants and
Mastercard preparing to do likewise, moves which bring both opportunity
and risk.

> “The more mainstream the digital currency becomes, the more we should
expect regulators to pay attention,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market
strategist at JonesTrading.
