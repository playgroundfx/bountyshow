The United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN,
recently proposed a series of new [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s applying to financial
institutions dealing with digital currencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC). To
summarize the proposed [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, exchanges would essentially be
required to file a report with FinCEN when a customer makes a purchase
in excess of $10,000, and gather Know Your Customer information any time
a transaction of $3,000 or greater is conducted using a non-custodial
wallet.

This means that if a customer buys $3,000 worth of Bitcoin and withdraws
it to a wallet they control, they would have to not only prove ownership
of that wallet but also provide their name and physical address, along
with additional identifying information.

Personally, my life stands to change very little. Iâ€™ve been living
entirely off of cryptocurrency since 2015, unbanked since 2016, and have
never used a centralized exchange, receiving all of my coins as
compensation for goods and services. But as few live as I do, we will
likely see a significant impact on how most cryptocurrency users conduct
their business. I would hazard a guess that most users have interacted
with a centralized platform requiring KYC.

For the rest of cryptocurrency users, the newly proposed [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s
would put a significant friction point on deposits and withdrawals. At
present, a user signs up to an exchange, submits KYC documents for
approval, and can buy and withdraw Bitcoin to a wallet they control,
including a hardware wallet for cold storage. When wishing to realize
gains, they can then move the funds back onto the exchange and sell for
spending money in the bank.

In the future, however, they may be required to prove ownership of the
wallet to which they withdraw, including providing their physical
address, and similarly, prove the origin of the funds when moving back
on to an exchange. This may lead many users, including the privacy- and
autonomy-conscious (of which there are many in the Bitcoin world), to
seek other, less intrusive ways of using their digital funds. Making
payments directly for the goods and services they desire, rather than
first selling for fiat currency, avoids the headache of passing through
the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)-induced friction point every time.
