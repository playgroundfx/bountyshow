The price of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network, has been soaring since the beginning of the new
year. What’s more, it has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) since Jan. 1,
gaining roughly 81% compared to Bitcoin’s 26% in their respective USD
pairs year-to-date.

There are three main reasons why ETH has been outpacing BTC throughout
the past several days. The factors are Ethereum’s accelerating growth,
the improving sentiment around DeFi and BTC’s current period of
relatively low volatility.

![3 Reasons why ETH has been Rising Faster than BTC Price][1]

DeFi tokens have been surging rapidly as of late, led by majors such as
Aave and SushiSwap, as Cointelegraph reported.

The rally of DeFi tokens is partly fueled by the fast-growing total
value locked (TVL) of the DeFi market, which estimates the amount of
capital deployed to DeFi protocols.

At over $24 billion, there is more capital locked across DeFi protocols
than ever before, which signals massive demand. This is crucial for the
momentum of Ethereum — and consequently its Ether token — because more
and more apps and tokens rely on its network.

The rising number of users is shown by the massive uptick in Ethereum
gas fees. Although high transaction fees are not ideal, Jacob Franek, a
partner at DeFi alliance, said this is a positive factor because it
shows the willingness of users to pay, indicating genuine demand.

Other layer one [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocols are growing with significant
anticipation to compete against Ethereum, like Polkadot and Cosmos.

However, in the foreseeable future, Ethereum’s network effect and the
combined value of DeFi protocols on Ethereum make it less likely that
Ethereum’s dominance in the DeFi sector would be challenged in the short
term.

BTC is consolidating with low volatility  
Throughout the past several days, Bitcoin has been mostly consolidating
with low volatility allowing many altcoins to catch up. This has led the
demand for altcoins with lower volume and liquidity to increase.

The Ether price rally coincides with what traders describe as
“altseason,” a period wherein many altcoins rally in tandem especially
when Bitcoin sees small price movements.

This altseason — [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly witnessed in the first months of the year
— occurs when Bitcoin is ranging and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seek high-risk plays.
Altcoins usually see bigger price movements because their low liquidity
makes them vulnerable to extreme volatility in short periods.

For retail and derivatives traders, the high volatility of the altcoin
market makes smaller cryptocurrencies more appealing, at least in the
near term, to trade over Bitcoin.
