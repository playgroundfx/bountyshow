The Bitcoin network mempool shrank to its smallest size since mid-
October this week after the network’s hash power soared. The clear
mempool meant that that thousands of stuck transactions pending
confirmation were included in recent blocks, leaving very few
unconfirmed transactions still outstanding.

The spike in hash power has been attributed to the re-activation of
China-based miners who migrated from Sichuan after the end of the
province’s rainy season. Bitcoin’s hash rate increased by 42% over a two
day period, Nov. 9 and 10.

A smaller mempool is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for regular Bitcoin users as it reduces
competition among fresh transactions to get included in upcoming blocks.
Reduced competition in the mempool helps to drive down Bitcoin
transaction fees, as miners can potentially include all transactions in
the mempool irrespective of their individual fee amounts.

Average Bitcoin transaction fees reached a peak of $13.16 per
transaction on Oct. 30, when more than 140,000 transactions were pending
in the mempool. The influx of new hash power over the weekend allowed
Bitcoin blocks to be found faster than the benchmark speed of 10 minutes
per block due to the network’s relatively low mining difficulty. This
allowed miners to reduce the number of unconfirmed transactions to zero
on Nov. 9.

As of this writing, there were approximately 6,000 transactions in the
mempool with a median fee of 3 satoshis per byte (sat/byte) or roughly
$0.11. Some users have reported fees as low as 1 sat/byte for
transactions that have confirmed within a few hours.

Mining difficulty was expected to increase upon the next adjustment to
account for the network’s increased hash power, which would mean the
current respite from high fees may be short lived. However the hash rate
is currently volatile and has dropped 37 EH/s in the past day.
