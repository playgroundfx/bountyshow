New data from Whalemap suggests that in order to maintain bullish
momentum Bitcoin price needs to hold above the $14,914 level. Whale
clusters, like the bubbles shown on the chart below, form when high-net-
worth [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s purchase Bitcoin and do not move them. This indicates
that whales accumulated BTC at that level and suggests that it will
likely remain as a support area in the event of a correction.

Hold][1]

As such, in the near term, it is crucial for Bitcoin to remain above
$14,914 for a prolonged period. It would signify consolidation under a
multiyear resistance at $16,000 and stability above a major support
level. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin has seen unusual price action
and been quite volatile in a broad range.

From Nov. 6 to Nov. 9, BTC tested the $16,000 level twice and fell to as
low as $14,350. This short-term volatility was likely connected a range
of macro events, including the ‘contested’ U.S. election results. There
have been a number of big risks in the market since early November. The
election risk noticeably benefited Bitcoin as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sought out safe-
haven assets. Then, Pfizer’s vaccine breakthrough became an unexpected
variable, causing Bitcoin and gold to plunge.

Despite these uncertainties, Bitcoin has remained comfortably above
$13,600, a level which Whalemap analysts pinpointed. They wrote: “New
levels that formed over the weekend! If we start ranging this should be
a good guide to what the levels should be. Price should stay above
~$13,600 to continue the bull run.”

In the short term, the $13,600 to $14,914 range remains the most
important for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. So far, the momentum of BTC
has been relatively strong, considering that miners have been selling.
As Cointelegraph previously reported, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said
in an interview that miners have been selling Bitcoin. Based on the
resilience of BTC, new buyer demand likely countered the selling
pressure coming from miners.
