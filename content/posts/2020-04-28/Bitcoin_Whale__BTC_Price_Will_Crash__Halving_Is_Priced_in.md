A major Bitcoin whale has implied that the upcoming halving is already
priced in and BTC price can crash after the reward reduction.

The third Bitcoin (BTC) block reward halving is set to occur in 14 days
and this event is usually preceded by a powerful rally that many have
long forecast would bring the digital asset to a new all-time high.

Surprisingly, Joe007, one of the biggest Bitcoin whales in the
cryptocurrency market, has implied that the halving is already priced
in, which may leave the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a crash.

In a sarcastic tone, Joe007 said: “No, of course it’s not priced in. On
the very day of The Great Halvening, everybody will finally realize how
underpriced BTC is, and they will all rush to buy it. In droves. With
their unemployment checks.”

Joe007 is estimated to be holding a large Bitcoin short position, as
shown by data from the Bitfinex leaderboard. It indicates that the
trader is down $11.3 million in the past month. Given that the Bitcoin
price has increased to around $7,700, it shows the whale is holding a
large short position and expects the price of BTC to decrease in the
short-term.

A big correction cannot be ruled out  
Billionaire [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s like Marc Cuban, Carl Icahn, and Paul Tudor Jones
are increasingly moving towards cash, hedging their positions
anticipating big downtrends to arrive in the stock market in the short-
term.

As the coronavirus pandemic expands and major countries remain unsure
when to reopen their economies, high-risk assets like single stocks and
cryptocurrencies could see subsiding momentum in the coming weeks.

At a technical level, despite the imminence of the halving, a rejection
of Bitcoin at a key level like a 200-day SMA at $8,000 could lead to a
strong market pullback, as seen in May and October 2019.
