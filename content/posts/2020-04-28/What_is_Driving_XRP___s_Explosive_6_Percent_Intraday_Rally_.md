The number three ranked cryptocurrency by market cap, XRP, exploded this
morning, rising more than 6 percent in less than two hours of intraday
trading. Will the Ripple rally continue? And what are the driving forces
responsible for today’s surging XRP prices?

After two and a half years of selling, XRP may finally be staging its
recovery rally. XRP this morning had an explosive price surge, rising
from $0.19749 to $0.21075 – or just under a 7 percent rally. Key factors
behind the strong rally include multiple TD 9 buy signals stacking
across many high timeframes, on both the XRPUSD and XRPBTC trading
pairs. XRP also reclaimed a critical trendline recently, which could be
in part responsible for the additional push. The rally could be the
start of a powerful Ripple fractal nearing the next phase of the
pattern: a further rally upward bringing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s a few hundred percent
returns.

Although market conditions may appear bleak, stimulus money could be
making its way into what is one of the lowest cost cryptocurrencies per
token in the top ten crypto assets by market cap. Newcomers buying
crypto their first time may opt for XRP, over Bitcoin at over $7,000 a
coin. If the Ripple rally can sustain, the crypto market may be in for a
shocking surprise. According to a fractal that has formed on XRP price
charts, the altcoin could see a major boost in the days and weeks ahead.
The fractal points to XRP holding an important trendline after multiple
attempts were made to push the asset back below. Once the trend line was
confirmed as support, Ripple rallied by over 800 percent.

After a short pullback, it rocketed another 900 percent. In the final
move up, XRP gained another 1000 percent, taking the asset to its all-
time high at over $3.50. The asset became the poster child for crypto
investing success alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in late 2017. It even
made an appearance in a segment on CNBC, educating [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
buy the then hyped altcoin. That as the signal the top was in. Could
this latest rally be the signal that Ripple has bottomed?
