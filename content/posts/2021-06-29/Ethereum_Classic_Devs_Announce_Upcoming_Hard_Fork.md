![Ethereum Classic devs announce upcoming hard fork][1]

On Monday, developers of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) announced
a hard fork to implement the project’s latest version, now scheduled for
launch in late July. The upgrade, which the community has dubbed
“Magneto,” will include the four Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or
EIPs, first seen in Ethereum’s Berlin upgrade earlier this year. These
proposals are meant to improve the network’s security, while saving on
gas costs by storing addresses and keys in one place for users to access
with a single transaction.

Beta testing on ETC’s Morder and Kotti testnets began on June 2 and June
9, respectively. The Magneto fork is set to officially occur once these
tests have concluded. Stevan Lohja, developer relations manager for
Mantis — a full-featured client and wallet for Ethereum Classic — told
the ETC community: “To ensure a successful fork, we ask ETC consumers to
upgrade their node software to a Magneto compatible version if they have
not done so already. If you’re not operating nodes or services, but use
ETC through other services, then check with that service to ensure
they’re supporting the Magneto hard fork.”

Ethereum Classic was originally created under rocky circumstances back
in 2016. The protocol forked from the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet due to the
$60 million hack of a project known simply as “the DAO” — an early
decentralized autonomous organization. Following the exploit, Ethereum’s
developers decided to roll back the malicious transactions in an attempt
to circumvent the hacker and return the stolen funds to their proper
owners.

Some believed that undoing these transactions would in effect override
one of Ethereum’s core tenets — “Code is law”. These users felt that it
was better to accept the loss and learn from the engineering mistakes
that allowed the hacker to siphon the funds. As a result, the Ethereum
Classic project forked away from Ethereum in an effort to preserve what
some felt was the most accurate representation of the project’s
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).
