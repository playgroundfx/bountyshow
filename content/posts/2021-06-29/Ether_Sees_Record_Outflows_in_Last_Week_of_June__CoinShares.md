NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ether investment products and funds posted record
outflows in the last week of June, bearing the brunt of negative
sentiment on cryptocurrencies, according to data on Monday from digital
asset manager CoinShares.

Institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s took out $50 million from investment products
and funds on ether, the token used for the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). Ether
suffered outflows for a fourth consecutive week, data showed.

For the month of June, ether has lost roughly 22% of its value against
the dollar. On Monday, however, ether was up 5.4% at $2,091.96.

Bitcoin products and funds, meanwhile, suffered a seventh straight week
of outflows, totaling $1.3 million. For the year, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) outflows hit
about $490 million.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was down 8.4% against the dollar so
far in June. Since an all-time high of just under $65,000 hit in mid-
April, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has plunged nearly 46%.

“We expect [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) consolidation to continue for the next few weeks
until a decisive move takes place,” said Pankaj Balani, chief executive
officer at crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange.

“If the global macro environment deteriorates on account of the
decreasing pace of global liquidity, it’s expected that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may
break the crucial level of $30,000 and challenge the highs of the
previous cycle at $20,00. Until then, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is likely to be in this
range and can set up a classic bull trap above $42,000.”

Overall, crypto investment products saw a fourth consecutive week of
outflows, totaling $44 million. Since mid-May, as negative sentiment
spread, net weekly outflows have hit $313 million, or 0.8% of total
assets under management.

Sentiment on cryptocurrencies has been crushed amid a crackdown on the
sector by China, which banned [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining activities.

In addition, British and Japanese regulators have independently issued
warnings against Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency
exchanges. Britain’s financial regulator over the weekend said Binance
cannot conduct any regulated activity and issued a warning to consumers
about the platform.

Japan also issued a similar warning to Binance stating that it has been
providing crypto exchange services to Japanese customers without
registration.

Crypto assets under management also declined in the latest week to about
$38 billion. At the end of April, that AUM was at $65 billion.
