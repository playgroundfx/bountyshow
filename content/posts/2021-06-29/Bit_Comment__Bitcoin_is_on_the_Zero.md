![Bit-Comment: Bitcoin is on the zero][1]

Bitcoin has been showing zero price momentum over the past 24 hours,
trading around $ 34,600. The crypto market as a whole is in a state
where a reversal in either direction is possible. There is no doubt that
market participants will react to what is happening on the stock market.
The Fed is trying with all its might to prevent panic, so the indices
continue to rise. Nevertheless, everyone understands that the market is
heavily overbought, and the main question that everyone is asking
themselves now is: what exactly can trigger a wide sale in the
traditional market, which will drag the crypto market down with it.

The Greed and Fear Index for Bitcoin and the largest cryptocurrencies is
at around 25, which corresponds to the “extreme fear” mode, quite
straightforwardly reflecting the market situation. Despite the rapid
buyback of the coin around $ 30K, risks remain that large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will
start taking profits along with the traditional market. In addition, the
crypto community is closely watching the migration of miners from China.

In this context, we can rather talk about the advantages for the market,
since even if the cost of Bitcoin mining rises, this can have a positive
effect on the coin rate. It is believed that the growth of any physical
indicator, including the hash rate or the cost of the coin, can
positively affect the price dynamics of the cryptocurrency.
