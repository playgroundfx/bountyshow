Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, sees
$19,511 as a “resistance” level, a price point the world’s oldest
cryptocurrency can break through in this time of highly bullish
sentiment. “An eventual breakout appears likely from a momentum
perspective,” she said, noting that $19,511 “is not a strong resistance
level – $20,000 is a psychological hurdle, much like Dow 30,000.”

Analysts are also keeping an eye on ether. The all-time high for the
native currency of the Ethereum network is over $1,400 and many think
the cryptocurrency is a good buy in this bull market.

> “I think ETH is still undervalued versus BTC,” noted George Clayton,
managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital. “All this
DeFi (decentralized finance) going on is showing the utility of smart
contract protocols.”

Is [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) leading ether?

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,
was down Tuesday, trading around $596 and slipping 2% in 24 hours as of
21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET).

Over the past several days, ether has mirrored [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price rise
closely. The correlation between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether is also trending
upward, though is lower than it was after the March market meltdown.

The fact the two cryptocurrencies are increasingly trading in tandem
belies the fact that Ethereum’s 2.0 Beacon Chain launch clearly
differentiates some of its use case aspects. While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s “store of
value” narrative continues to be a strong signal coming from industry
analysts, the “programmable money” thesis of Ethereum doesn’t seem to be
making the market asset perform based on its own fundamentals – yet.

> “Both assets have definitely seen a [U.S. dollar]-priced upswing, and
though BTC has been the one to have a lot of recent [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) around its
proximity to all time highs, Ethereum has been the real star of the
summer of DeFi and into the fall compared to BTC,” noted John Willock,
chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritium. “I believe
that as confidence in 2.0 with some operating [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and broader
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) understanding of the economic implications to the valuation of
ETH spreads, we will see a bull run in ETH,” he added.
