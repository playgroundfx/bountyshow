As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) continues to set new price highs, its network is also seeing
record-breaking user activity. As of Tuesday, there were 432,451 “active
entities” – wallet clusters controlled by a single participant that sent
or received funds in a 24-hour period. That’s an all-time high,
according to data provided by [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analytics firm Glassnode. The
previous peak of 410,972 was registered on Dec. 9, 2017.

> “The number of active entities has been increasing steadily since the
halving and signifies a large increase in network adoption by
participants,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of
cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving on May 11 of this
year. Since then, the number of active entities has increased by 70% and
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price has more than doubled to nearly $20,000.

The cryptocurrency printed a record high of $19,920,53 on Tuesday before
falling back. Bitcoin was trading around $19,130 at time of writing,
representing a 1.7% gain on the day.

While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price gains have been relatively sharp over the past
eight weeks, the number of active entities has charted relatively steady
growth. “While the metric has breached highs not seen since 2017, it has
done so gradually without ‘bubble-like’ growth,” Dibb told CoinDesk. “We
take comfort in this when correlating address clusters with forward-
looking price action.”

Analysts consider increased activity as a bullish sign. “When there’s
greater usage, there’s more demand for the cryptocurrency, and that
drives the price up,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
intelligence firm Chainalysis, previously told CoinDesk.
