Bitcoin has unsuccessfully tried to reach the long-awaited psychological
level of $20K several times. All attempts so far have ended with profit-
taking and correction. The main question that now concerns all
participants of the crypto market – is the current situation a
reflection of the strong resistance or consolidation before a new spike?

![Bitcoin: tough all-time high][1]

A large-scale correction can form an impulse for continued growth by
attracting buyers looking for discounts. Therefore, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do
not pay attention to such turbulence. At the head of the current rally
are large institutions, funds, and even the world’s largest payment
system PayPal, which is integrating top cryptocurrencies into its
service.

The next most important question, even for crypto enthusiasts: what is
the maximum for Bitcoin in the case that the coin manages to overcome
the $20K? Almost no one doubts that Bitcoin will manage to overcome this
level, and on the FOMO wave, it is quite probable that the coin will
soon reach $23-$25K and its growth potential will exceed $35K in the
future. Of course, such impressive growth will be alternated by profit-
taking [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who waited three years for Bitcoin’s return to the
levels of the previous mania.

Nevertheless, even in this case, long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are unlikely to
sell the asset, as the size of this market is relatively small compared
to the traditional one, which now has a lot of money but few directions
for investment. Even the current levels of Bitcoin, which are very high
by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards, are not an obstacle for large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
absorb almost all the coins that appear on the market. Such a process
naturally creates a deficit in the market and leads to Bitcoin
appreciation. By the end of 2021, we can witness growth potentially up
to $36-$40K.

In 2017, large capital didn’t see the huge potential of Bitcoin and
watched global retail FOMO push the value to a historic high without any
serious investment infrastructure. Now everything has changed: the
rallies are created by institutions, and retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have just
begun to move towards Bitcoin. The big difference is that major
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were able to collapse the market in 2017 but retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are unlikely to be able to do the same now by taking a profit. Will they
even want to do it against the backdrop of a rush for growth?

The current bullish pattern will come down to making most market
participants believe in the imminent growth of Bitcoin. This will be
quite easy to do, given the challenges the global economy faces and how
quickly entire industries that enjoyed growth previously can depreciate.
