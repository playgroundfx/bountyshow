HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) -A cryptocurrency platform has lost
an estimated $600 million in digital tokens in one of the sector’s
biggest ever cyberheists, according to details of the heist emerging on
Wednesday.

Poly Network, a so-called decentralised finance platform that
facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, announced the hack on Twitter and
posted details of digital wallets to which it said the money was
transferred, urging people to blacklist tokens from those addresses.

The value of the tokens in the wallets cited by the platform was just
over $600 million at the time of the announcement, according to crypto
trade publication The Block.

Poly Network did not respond to requests for further detail about the
heist. It was not immediately clear where the platform is based, or
whether any law enforcement agency was investigating the heist.

The platform tweeted it planned to take legal action and urged the
hackers to return the stolen funds to several of its digital addresses.

The plea looked to be gaining some traction, with around $4.8 million in
stolen tokens returned by Wednesday afternoon, according to public
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) records and crypto tracking firm Elliptic. Analysts cited the
headaches of laundering stolen crypto on such a scale as a possible
motivation for the move.

The theft appeared to be one of the biggest ever in cryptocurrency
markets, and was on a par with the $530 million in digital coins stolen
from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck in 2018. The Mt. Gox exchange, also
based in Tokyo, collapsed in 2014 after losing half a billion dollars in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

The latest attack comes as losses from theft, hacks and [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) related to
decentralised finance (DeFi) hit an all-time high, raising the risk of
both investing in the sector and of regulators looking to shake it down.

DeFi platforms allow financial transactions, usually in cryptocurrency,
without traditional gatekeepers such as banks or exchanges. The sector
has boomed over the last year, with platforms now handling more than $80
billion worth of digital coins.

Poly Network allows users to swap tokens across different [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s.

## STOLEN CRYPTO

> “It is a massive hack ... as large as Mt. Gox,” said Bobby Ong, co-
founder of crypto analytics [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) CoinGecko, although he noted the
fallout had not yet hurt major crypto prices. “This project is finished
in my opinion. (It is) going to take a lot to regain confidence.”

Yet the retrieval of some of the tokens underscores the difficulty of
laundering large amounts of stolen crypto, said Tom Robinson, Elliptic
co-founder.

> “There’s so much public attention on this, and exchanges will be on
the lookout for customer deposits linked to this theft,” Robinson said.

>

> “This demonstrates that even if you can steal cryptoassets, laundering
them and cashing out is extremely difficult, due to the transparency of
the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and the broad use of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analytics by financial
institutions.”

The hacker or hackers sent a message with some of the returned coins
appearing to ask for donations, Robinson added.

Still, the stolen funds amount to more than the criminal losses
registered by the entire DeFi sector from January to July of a record
$474 million, according to a report from crypto intelligence company
CipherTrace.

Proponents of DeFi say it offers people and businesses free access to
financial services, arguing that the technology will cut costs and boost
economic activity.

Yet it is mostly unregulated, with technical flaws and weaknesses in the
code many platforms use leaving it vulnerable to hacks and heists.

The chief technology officer of Tether, a stablecoin or type of
cryptocurrency usually backed by real-world world assets, said on
Twitter the company had frozen $33 million connected with the hack, and
top management at large crypto exchanges responded to Poly on Twitter
saying they would try to help.
