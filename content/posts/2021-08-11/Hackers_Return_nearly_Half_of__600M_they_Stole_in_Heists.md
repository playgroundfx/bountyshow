![Hackers return nearly half of the $600 million they stole in one of
the biggest crypto heists][1]

Hackers have returned nearly half of the $600 million they stole in
what’s likely to be one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts ever. The
cybercriminals exploited a vulnerability in Poly Network, a platform
that looks to connect different [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s so that they can work
together.

Poly Network disclosed the attack Tuesday and asked to establish
communication with the hackers, urging them to “return the hacked
assets.” A [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) is a ledger of activities upon which various
cryptocurrencies are based. Each digital coin has its own [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and
they’re different from each other. Poly Network claims to be able to
make these various [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s work with each other.

Poly Network is a decentralized finance platform. DeFi is a broad term
encompassing financial applications based on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology that
looks to cut out intermediaries — such as brokerages and exchanges.
Hence, it’s dubbed decentralized. They sent a message to Poly Network
embedded in a cryptocurrency transaction saying they were “ready to
return” the funds. The DeFi platform responded requesting the money be
sent to three crypto addresses.

As of 7 a.m. London time, more than $4.8 million had been returned to
the Poly Network addresses. By 11 a.m. ET, about $258 million had been
sent back. “I think this demonstrates that even if you can steal
cryptoassets, laundering them and cashing out is extremely difficult,
due to the transparency of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and the use of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
analytics,” Tom Robinson, chief scientist of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analytics firm
Elliptic, said via email. “In this case the hacker concluded that the
safest option was just to return the stolen assets.”

Once the hackers stole the money, they began to send it to various other
cryptocurrency addresses. Researchers at security company SlowMist said
a total of more than $610 million worth of cryptocurrency was
transferred to three addresses.

SlowMist said in a tweet that its researchers had “grasped the
attacker’s mailbox, IP, and device fingerprints” and are “tracking
possible identity clues related to the Poly Network attacker.” The
researchers concluded that the theft was “likely to be a long-planned,
organized and prepared attack.” Poly Network urged cryptocurrency
exchanges to “blacklist tokens” coming from the addresses that were
linked to the hackers.
