In the aftermath of criminal charges against BitMEX, the crypto
community is debating whether the decentralized finance sector is also
set to face the wrath of regulators. On Oct 1, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission announced charges against three BitMEX
executives for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) due to the
exchange’s allegedly weak anti-money laundering and know-your-customer
(KYC) policies.

DeFi protocols, including Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) have made a
virtue of having minimal AML and KYC procedurs. However many now wonder
if DEXs are also obliged to comply with the BSA, even though most
projects seek to decentralize ownership and governance throughout their
communities.

While many DeFi protocols appear to believe that they can evade
regulators simply by becoming fully decentralized, there are increasing
doubts as to whether this is true — and in any case, DeFi protocols have
come under fire recently for operating with a high degree of
centralization, with 12 out of 15 top projects maintaining ‘God Mode’
admin keys.

In a 25-post Twitter-thread, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) consultant Adam
Cochran examined the potential fall out from the BitMEX charges for DeFi
protocols. He argued that while authorities cannot directly shut down a
DEX due to its decentralized nature, regulators could target the core
developers who hold the admin keys and the domain providers hosting the
front-end interfaces of DEXs:

> “If that happened to a protocol, a large bulk of users would stop
using it and not interact with the contract directly, essentially
killing the protocol,” he said. “The takeaway here is that a protocol
isn’t outside the reach of the government, there is always pressure
points that can be applied.”

But Cochran believes the crypto community should actually want
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s like the BSA to apply to DeFi, adding that “there is a
difference between wanting sovereignty and privacy over your funds vs
enabling criminal activity.”
