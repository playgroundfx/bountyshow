Bitcoin is making gains, though much of the day saw the cryptocurrency
in a holding pattern. Meanwhile, a quarter of ether [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are expiring
in March, meaning traders are making some bets on the first fiscal
quarter of 2021.

![BTC Claws Back to $36.4K, 25% of ETH Options Will Expire in March][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,286 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).
Gaining 5.5% over the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin’s 24-hour range:
$32,463-$36,552 (CoinDesk 20). BTC above the 10-hour and 50-hour moving
averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

Bitcoin was able to recover from a drop in price Wednesday. After going
as low as $32,463 around 01:00 UTC (8 p.m. ET Tuesday), it was able to
stay in a $34,500-$35,000 range before breaking out to $36,464 before
settling at $36,286 as of press time. Despite the past few hours of
price gains, analysts refer to a day of little price action as a
“sideways” or “flat” market. It’s not clear after so much excitement for
the world’s oldest cryptocurrency in the first few days of 2021 what
might happen next for the price, according to Misha Alefirenko, founder
of crypto market maker VelvetFormula.

Bitcoin spot volumes were clearly taking a breather after Monday’s
record-high [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) zenith of $13.5 billion for the eight exchanges
tracked by the CoinDesk 20. For Wednesday, the tally was at $4 billion
as of press time, closer to the past month’s $3.8 billion [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) spot
average.
