The top 100 richest Bitcoin addresses are increasingly bullish,
accumulating 16% more Bitcoin over the last 30 days. In total these
addresses added 334,000 more Bitcoin to their bags, or around $11
billion worth. The majority barely reacted to Bitcoin’s recent price
drop from $41,000 to below $33,000. Only seven addresses conducted a
transfer out of the wallet since the most recent all-time-high on
January 10.

Days][1]

Of the addresses that have transacted in the last 30 days, only eight of
them have more than ten transactions to their name since December 12.
Perhaps surprisingly, many of the largest addresses are yet to see a
bull run, with eight of the top ten having received their first
transaction later than September 2018. The newest in the top 100 is only
two months old.

They’re not all individual whales however. The addresses include at
least ten controlled by exchanges such as Huobi, Binance, Bittrex, and
Kraken. The rest are believed to belong to a mix of institutional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and wealthy hodlers, with it being almost impossible to
differentiate between two. What is clear though, is that the big guys
are not easily influenced by price or sentiment.

In order to make it into the top echelon of Bitcoin addresses, one must
hold more than $336 million in BTC. Around $2.2 billion is required to
hit the top ten. Addresses within this prestigious list have often
attracted attention for various reasons, including one that is believed
to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto himself.

The third wealthiest address, with an untouched 94,506 BTC, created
headlines back in September 2019 after Glassnode reported that 73,000 of
the BTC in the wallet had been transferred from Huobi. It was presumed
to be the richest non-exchange address.
