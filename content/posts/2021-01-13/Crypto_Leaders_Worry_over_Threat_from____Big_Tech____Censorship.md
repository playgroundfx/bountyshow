Social media users are leaving traditional providers in droves in favor
of more independent platforms over fears of unwarranted data collection,
censorship, and refusal of service. A change to WhatsApp’s [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
service has triggered a mass exodus from the messaging platform to more
private and independent rivals like Telegram and Signal, which have
registered millions of new users over the last week.

![Crypto Leaders Worry over Threat from ‘Big Tech’ Censorship][1]

Rather than agreeing to new [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) specifying the app’s right to share
user data with Facebook, millions of WhatsApp users simply gave up using
the platform, abandoning it for less-intrusive competitors. Telegram
alone has been downloaded 25 million times in the last 72 hours. Some of
those new sign-ups include refugees from the free speech platform
Parler, looking for a way to connect and organize after the right-wing
Twitter alternative was suddenly yanked offline by hosting services
provider Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The ability of web hosting giants like AWS to unilaterally close down
sites and infrastructure has some in the cryptocurrency industry worried
for the future health of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-related projects. Ethereum co-
founder Vitalik Buterin described Parler’s takedown as “very worrying”
in a series of tweets, noting that AWS was much more of a “common
infrastructure provider” than a social media site. Buterin also
expressed a certain level of dismay over Twitter’s decision to
permanently ban President Donald Trump from its platform.

Decentralized solutions providers, like domain name server Handshake,
are censorship-resistant in that they avoid reliance on classical
processes for domain name resolution. Pirate academic journal archivists
Sci-Hub switched DNS providers using Handshake, as mentioned by Buterin.

Censorship concerns aren’t the only reason why reliance on a single
hosting service provider poses risks to crypto-based services. In
November, AWS outages affected Coinbase, causing users to have problems
logging in to and navigating their accounts.
