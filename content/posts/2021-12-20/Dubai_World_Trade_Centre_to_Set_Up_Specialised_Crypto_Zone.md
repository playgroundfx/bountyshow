DUBAI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) will
become a crypto zone and regulator for cryptocurrencies and other
virtual assets, the Dubai Media Office said on Monday, part of efforts
to attract new business as regional economic competition heats up.

The move by the DWTC to create a specialised zone for virtual assets -
including digital assets, products, operators and exchanges - is part of
a drive by Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates federation of seven
emirates, to create new economic sectors, the statement said.

> "Rigorous standards for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) protection, anti money laundering,
combating the financing of terrorism, compliance and cross border deal
flow tracing," will be developed, it said.

In September, the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority and the Dubai
World Trade Centre Authority (DWTCA) agreed a framework that allows the
DWTCA to approve and licence financial activities relating to crypto
assets.

In October, another Dubai free zone DIFC, Dubai's state-owned financial
free zone and the Middle East's major finance centre, released the first
part of a regulatory framework for digital tokens.
