The crypto market’s capitalisation has fallen 2.8% in the last 24 hours
to $2.166 trillion. Methodical pressure on the significant coins
persists along with wary trading in traditional equity markets.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price has been losing 2.5% in the last 24 hours and is 5.6%
lower than it was exactly a week ago. Ether is down 3.4% and 4%,
respectively. Some other top coins are also under severe pressure, but
we cannot say that the dynamics are unambiguous. For example, XRP is up
5.5%, AVAX is up 22%, and Luna is up 30.7% in the last seven days.

At the beginning of the year, institutional and investment bank interest
provided cryptocurrencies with overperformance but now lowered demand
for safety is becoming their Achilles’ heel. The most methodical, albeit
relatively measured, pressure has been seen in Bitcoin and Ether, which
have been under bearish control for the past month and a half.

According to equity and commodity market definitions, BTCUSD and ETHUSD
have crossed the bear market threshold, having lost more than 20% of
their peaks in early November. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is not gaining
meaningful support on the decline towards the 200-day average. These are
all signs that the bear market is entering its rights, as enthusiasts
can no longer buy out any drawdowns.

Generally speaking, a modest downside amplitude is not typical of
cryptocurrencies, so short-term traders should be prepared for an
explosion of volatility on a decline below a meaningful level.

We assume that crucial support is concentrated near $40K for Bitcoin, a
resistance level in January and a support level in October. Falling
below this level could dramatically increase the coin’s volatility and
affect the entire market.

For Ether, relatively measured volatility could continue up to the level
of the 200-day moving average (just above 3300), which coincides with
the area of extended consolidation in August and September and the start
of the latest rally in October.

Suppose Ether and Bitcoin fail to find strong buying below these levels
as well. In that case, we risk seeing a true capitulation of the entire
cryptocurrency market and a revision of the outlook to a more bearish
one.
