Tesla just contributed to Bitcoin open source software. The car maker
disclosed a bug in the open-source Bitcoin payment processor and wallet
BTCPay Server, and it also helped the project’s team patch the flaw. The
electric vehicle and renewables company informed BTCPay’s team of the
bug after reviewing the project’s GitHub last week. It affects users who
boot BTCPay from “Docker Deployment, have a configured email server and
enabled registration for users in Server Settings > Policies,” according
to a post on BTCPay’s GitHub that included a software patch.

> “The security team did an audit and [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)ed us. We then focused on
fixing most of the points they disclosed one by one. They are now
helping us to improve our process for security related disclosure,”
BTCPay founder Nicolas Dorier told CoinDesk. The BTCPay team wrote in
its GitHub post that more information on the bug would be disclosed in
BTCPay’s next major release.

> “We want to thank @teslamotors for filing a responsible disclosure,
helping us with remediation, and handling the situation professionally.
We also want to thank Qaiser Abbas, an independent web-security
researcher, for an additional responsible vulnerability disclosure that
was handled in this release,” BTCPay’s team wrote in the software
release fixing the bug.

BTCPay Server was launched in 2017 by Bitcoin developer Nicola Dorier in
response to popular Bitcoin payment processor BitPay’s controversial
statements regarding the 2016 SegWit soft fork. Since launching, BTCPay
has been integrated as a donations portal for charitable efforts around
the world, including Nigeria and Venezuela.
