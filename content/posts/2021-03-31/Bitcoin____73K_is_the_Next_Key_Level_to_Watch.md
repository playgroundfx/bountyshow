The price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a correction in the run-up to the record
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) expiry last Friday. However, nothing happened despite some
expecting a massive move on the same day. The actual correction occurred
before the event. On the day itself, Bitcoin’s price has bottomed out
and began to rally. The ongoing rally above $59,000 is being fueled by
bullish [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Visa and PayPal as both are getting into Bitcoin and
cryptocurrency payments. Put differently, the market is very much in the
middle of the bull cycle and any correction is a blessing to traders and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

![Bitcoin nears all-time highs — Here’s why $73K is the next key level
to watch][1]

As the chart above shows, the critical support area between $49,500 and
$51,000 was just tested last week. Since the support held, another
higher low was made, resulting in renewed upward momentum, which is
playing out this week. The entire structure since September is massively
bullish when the market broke above $12,000 and started to accelerate.
The previous higher low was made at $42,000, which then became the
critical support area to hold. As Bitcoin’s price didn’t even need such
a heavy correction this time around, the recent low at $49,500-$51,000
can be classified as the new higher low.

Therefore, the next points of interest can be made through the Fibonacci
extension, where $73,000 and $92,000 become the next points of interest
if Bitcoin’s price breaks above the current all-time high at around
$61,000. The total market capitalization shows a similar support test as
the $1.5 trillion levels were critical to hold. Since the total market
cap of crypto survived that correction, more upside is very likely as
the all-time high regions will be tested.
