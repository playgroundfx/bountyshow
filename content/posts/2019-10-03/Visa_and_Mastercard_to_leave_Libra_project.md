A large flow of [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from all sides regarding the new Facebook project
was not in vain. It was that rainy day for Facebook when potential
partner companies that expressed a desire to participate in this project
began to refuse cooperation one at a time. So, Visa, Mastercard and a
number of other financial companies are going to refuse to cooperate
with the company on the development of Libra project.

The reason for these developments is quite simple - Zuckerberg’s idea
was widely criticized by U.S. and European authorities. Thus, the U.S.
Treasury Secretary mentioned that the U.S. administration "is concerned
that [Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/) can be used by people involved in money laundering and the
terrorism financing."

The U.S. President also didn’t stay away from the issue, noting that
[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/) will have "low stability and reliability."

G7 finance ministers warned that Facebook cryptocurrency could adversely
affect the functioning of the whole international currency system.

Recall, Facebook in June announced its plans to launch its own
cryptocurrency Libra in the 2020th. According to the company
information, a digital currency transfer will be as simple as sending
SMS to the phone. The functioning of the new currency will be based on
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology - a decentralized database, the storage devices of
which are not connected to a common server. A number of major U.S.
corporations, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber, previously
announced that they intend to invest $10 million each in creating a
consortium that will be managed by Libra.

As for the cryptocurrencies rates, the Friday’s reading is as follows:

  * Bitcoin slipped by 0.05 percent, to 8.152;

  * Ripple jumped by 2.55 percent, to 0.252;

  * Litecoin rose by 1.50 percent, to 56.81;

  * Ethereum added 1.26 percent, to 174.92;

  * Bitcoin cash grew by 1.14 percent, to 222.40 at 10.14 GMT.
