MOSCOW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank ratcheted up its
campaign against private cryptocurrencies on Friday, a day after Reuters
reported it wants to ban investments in them.

Valeriy Lyakh, head of its department for countering market misconduct,
said in a video that investment in cryptocurrencies was an "out-and-out
swindle" and a "financial pyramid".

The market was volatile and had no [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), Lyakh said, adding that
nobody investigated manipulation in it.

Russia opposed private cryptocurrencies for years, saying they could be
used in money laundering or to finance terrorism.

Although it gave them legal status in 2020, it banned their use as a
means of payment.

> "We have a negative attitude towards crypto currencies. We definitely
do not support any circulation of it in our country," Lyakh said in the
video.

Sources told Reuters on Thursday that Russia's central bank sees risks
to financial stability in the rising number of crypto transactions and
advocates a "complete rejection" of them, sending [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) falling.Â [read

In a reply to Reuters' request for comment, the central bank said it was
preparing an [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y report to set out its stance on the issue. It did
not comment on specifics.

The Bank of Russia has previously said the country needed a further
adjustment of cryptocurrency [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), pointing to the experience of
China and India.

In September, China intensified its crackdown on cryptocurrencies with a
blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and
other major coins and pressuring crypto and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-related stocks.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia is planning to issue its own digital
rouble, joining the global trend to develop digital currencies to
modernise financial systems, speed up payments and counter a potential
threat from other cryptocurrencies.
