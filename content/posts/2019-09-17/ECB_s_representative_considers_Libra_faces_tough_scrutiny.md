Francois Villeroy de Galhau, an ECB board member, said on Tuesday that
Facebook’s Libra and other similar projects highlight gaps in laws and
the Facebook’s new payments project encountered a serious regulatory
approach.

Villeroy added, that despite the fact Facebook’s planned Libra as the
most well-known one among stable coins differs widely from Bitcoins and
this fact requires close control on the global level and promised to do
his utmost to the end.

There was information, that Facebook intended to seek payments services
license in Switzerland, but this doesn’t guarantee the regulators’
satisfaction.

ECB board member also added, that if Facebook has plans to offer some
types of banking services like financial investments, loans or deposits,
then the company should obtain a banking license in every country, where
its operations would be active.

It’s vital to mention, that new operators of payments sector are far
smaller than the Libra’s owner and they do not have such resources as
Facebook does and with it’s entrance on the market could redefine
financial system activities. So, the regulators experience a big
challenge, facing the Facebook’s ambitious plans.

One needed an European strategy for cross-border retail payments, as
this sector is dominated already by  companies from the U.S. and China.
So, it means a separate regulatory system, based on existing
infrastructure, as for example the ECB’s TARGET Instant Payment
Settlement (TIPS) system, asserted Villeroy.

As for the crypto rates, they are as follows: Bitcoin is at flat level
at $10,213, Ethereum tries to rise by 0.06 percent, at $199.14, Ripple
gained 5.18 percent, at $0.2750, Bitcoin Cash added 1.63 percent, at
$310.90 and Litecoin was up by 2.24 percent, ar $73.18 at 12.40 GMT.
