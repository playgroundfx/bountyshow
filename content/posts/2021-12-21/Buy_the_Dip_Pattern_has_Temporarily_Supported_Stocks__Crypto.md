Cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose 3.7% in the last 24 hours,
again reaching $2.24 trillion, with almost the entire top 100 coins in
green over the past 24 hours.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index has added 2 points to 27. This
is still a ‘fear level’, but the general dynamic over the past few hours
suggests that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are opting to buy with the expectation of a
further bounce from these levels.

Bitcoin and Ether have added around 4% in the past 24 hours, managing to
move back above the signal levels. BTCUSD is trading above the 200-day
average again, while ETHUSD has surpassed $4000.

If we went deeper into the reasons, the rise of the two largest
cryptocurrencies was helped by the performance of stock indices, which
received support from buyers yesterday, indicating continued demand for
risky assets and a buy-the-dip pattern.

Despite this morning’s positivity, it is worth noting that the optimism
looks somewhat fragile and has little explanation for the fundamentals.
Under such conditions, the situation could turn abruptly in a matter of
hours, so a fix above $4000 for Ether and $48000 for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) today
should be considered a more reliable signal.
