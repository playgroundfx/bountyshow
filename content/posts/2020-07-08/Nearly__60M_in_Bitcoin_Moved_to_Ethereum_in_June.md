Nearly $60 million worth of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s moved to Ethereum during June,
according to data estimates from Dune Analytics. Wrapped Bitcoin, the
oldest tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) protocol on Ethereum, is responsible for
roughly 75% of that growth after moving more than 4,800 BTC to Ethereum
last month.

Demand has increased for using [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in a variety of decentralized
financial services as Ethereum continues to be the most popular off-
chain destination for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s. More specifically, yield farming and
MakerDAO adding tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as collateral are likely strong
catalysts, said Medio Demarco, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-
founder of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital.

The increasing popularity of tokenized [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is also no surprise to
Ben Chan, CTO at BitGo, the cryptocurrency payments processor that
spearheaded Wrapped Bitcoin. “The purpose of WBTC is to bring [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to
the world of decentralized finance,” Chan said. “Yield opportunities for
lending and supplying WBTC” in Ethereum-based applications are driving
recent growth, he added. Currently $132 million worth of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is on
Ethereum, at the time of publication, or roughly 0.08% of the leading
cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, according to OnChainFX.

Is the growing demand to use [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) on Ethereum a positive signal for
the leading cryptocurrency? According to Demarco, the trend has a
“synergistic” effect for both [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s.
