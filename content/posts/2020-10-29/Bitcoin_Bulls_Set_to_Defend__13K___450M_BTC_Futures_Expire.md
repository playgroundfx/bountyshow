A total of 62K Bitcoin (BTC) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are set to expire this Friday, and
this is equivalent to $830 million in open interest. These massive
numbers fail to reflect the fact that 58% of these [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are now
deemed worthless. As we approach the expiry date, call (buy) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
above the current level begin to depreciate very fast. It is not worth
paying $20 for the opportunity to buy BTC at $14.5K on Friday morning.
Therefore, rolling [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) to the next month is not that helpful.

![Bitcoin bulls set to defend $13K as $450M in BTC futures expire
Friday][1]

With less than 48 hours to October’s expiry, call (buy) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) above
$14.5K and above face slim odds. The same can be said for the $11.5K put
(sell) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) which are currently trading below $10 apiece. Deribit
leads with a 70% market share of the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) that are still worthy.
Currently, there are $134 million worth of call (buy) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) from
$11.5K to $13.5K, stacked against $45.5 million in put (sell) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
from $12.5K to $14.5K. Thus, bulls favor bears by a ratio of 3:1.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds a 26% market share among the
October BTC [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) that still count. The call (buy) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) near the
current market level totals $72 million, whereas the put (sell) is less
than $1 million. This movement is not unlike past expiries as CME option
traders are usually extremely bullish.

Therefore, there’s currently a $160 million imbalance favoring bulls on
BTC option markets. This is a relevant number considering the expiry
happens at a set time. OKEx and Deribit [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and futures are set to
expire at 8:00 AM (UTC) on October 30, and the CME a few hours later at
4:00 PM (UTC).

Many traders believe that Bitcoin futures $5.4 billion open interest is
also set to expire on Friday. Most of those contracts are either
perpetual (inverse swap) or set for a later date. This time around, CME
leads with $360 million open interest for October, but there’s a catch.
This notional will drastically reduce ahead of expiry as traders move
their positions for upcoming months. As proof of this movement, the
CME’s outstanding October open interest was cut by $130 million
yesterday.

No matter how big an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)’s win or loss is, rolling over the
position for the next expiry is viable. Unlike [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) markets, futures
contracts don’t devalue nearing their last trading day.

Futures margin is adjusted [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), meaning, the contract buyer (long)
gets paid by the seller (short) when Bitcoin trades up, and the opposite
happens if BTC price closes down. Both sides can benefit from rolling
over their positions, as long as there’s enough margin to maintain it.

For professional traders, futures premium is the most useful indicator
to gauge how bullish or bearish those [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are. At the time of
writing, OKEx leads the remaining exchanges with $69 million set to
expire on Friday, followed by Huobi’s $23 million.

This indicator is known as basis, and it usually ranges between a 5% to
15% annualized rate. Whenever the premium is positive, the market is
characterized as being in contango. Meanwhile, levels below 5% indicate
modest bearishness.

A negative future contracts premium is highly unusual and is usually
related to liquidity issues.

As the above chart shows, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were very bullish in August, as the
1-month futures contract traded with a 25% or higher premium. That was
caused by a 30% Bitcoin hike from $9.1K to $11.9K.

The basis indicator currently stands near 14%, on the verge of a very
bullish zone. One must factor in that any leveraged bullish position
opened in the past six months is currently gaining.

Meanwhile, BTC futures open interest more than doubled to $5.4 billion
from $2.6 billion back in April. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are well prepared to defend the current $13K support level.
