The digital currencies are supported by dollars, some of them by gold,
but this cryptocurrency is buoyed by another digital rival.

The Facebook’s Libra, as a stablecoin, is the new one in the series of
cryptocurrencies striving to escape the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) high volatility, which
makes it unfavorable for commerce. So, these base on more reliable
assets, for example on diverse commodity types or traditional
currencies.

However, unlike the other Dai is supported by another digital currency
and namely, [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) - to buoy a safe value.

Dai was launched in 2017 and it is effectively backed by the dollar, and
supported by [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) cryptocurrency, that is locked in publicly
transparent contracts that are based on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

The great part of the stablecoins is trusted because of their cost, that
is derived by main bank currencies. Users believe in Dai because the
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/), embedded in contracts usually surpasses the cost of Dai, that
is in use.

When Dai’s price goes far away from the greenback, the balancing
mechanisms are stimulated to guide it back.

So, the regulators' attitude towards Dai could help shape how a
cryptocurrency may shift from a speculative one to actual digital money.
It’s up to them now.
