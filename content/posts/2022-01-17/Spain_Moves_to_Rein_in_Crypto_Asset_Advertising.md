MADRID, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Spain moved on Monday to regulate rampant
advertising of crypto assets, including by social media influencers,
tasking the stock market supervisor with authorising mass campaigns and
making sure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are aware of risks.

The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and digital assets pegged to
traditional currencies has drawn attention from regulators worldwide,
who fear they could put the financial system at risk if not monitored.

The Spanish government said in its official bulletin advertisers and
companies that market crypto assets will have to inform the CNMV
watchdog at least 10 days in advance about the content of campaigns
targeting more than 100,000 people.

The new [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s will start from mid-February and allow the CNMV to
specifically monitor advertising for all types of crypto assets and to
include warnings about risks involved in such investment.

The rules also apply to crypto-asset service providers when advertising
their activities and to any person advertising on their own or on behalf
of third parties.

These include influencers with more than 100,000 subscribers who are
paid to advertise and promote crypto assets, the CNMV said in a
statement, adding that they will have to pre-notify the watchdog of
promotional posts and to warn of risks.

In November, the CNMV scolded soccer star Andres Iniesta after he
promoted the [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) platform Binance on his Twitter and
Instagram accounts, telling him that he should be thoroughly informed
about cryptocurrencies before making any investment in them or
recommending others to do so. [read more][1]
