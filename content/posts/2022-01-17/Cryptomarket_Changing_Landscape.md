The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index has been cruising between 21-23
for the past seven days – in the extreme fear territory, finding itself
in the middle of that range on Monday.

Meanwhile, the value of all coins tracked by CoinMarketCap fell 0.5% in
the last 24 hours to $2.05 trillion. By and large, a sideways range,
$2.0-$2.1 trillion, has also been prevalent here for the past seven
days, marking a lull in bull and bear fighting. It remains to be seen
whether this signifies fatigue from the past months’ turbulent moves or
preparations for a new strong momentum.

The local victory is on the bears’ side, dominating the top coins now,
where losses range from -0.8% for Bitcoin to -5.7% for Polkadot over the
last 24 hours.

Bitcoin failed to build on last week’s upside momentum and is back in
the $41-42K consolidation area, approaching it from above. A decline
from these levels in the coming days will be a development of the
downtrend since November, reversing the BTCUSD from the upper boundary
of the downtrend channel.

A bearish scenario suggests a dip towards $31K by the end of this week
to close the July gap. But the door for such a decline will only open
after the bulls surrender the $40K level they managed to hold in
September and earlier in January.

Ether has also encountered a sell-off in its attempts to rise above
$3.3K. The 200-day moving average level is now acting as significant
resistance.

Bitcoin and Ether, which have a combined capitalisation of almost 60% of
all cryptocurrencies, show worryingly negative dynamics. At the same
time, their share has been declining since late last year. We are seeing
either a shift in [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) attitudes towards the sector leaders or
certain inertia of altcoins compared to the flagships.

Right now, it seems that crypto enthusiasts are not at all opposed to
the changing landscape. However, as is often the case in nature, such
changes rarely go smoothly.
