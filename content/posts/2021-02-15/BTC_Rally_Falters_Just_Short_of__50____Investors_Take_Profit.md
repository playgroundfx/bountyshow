Bitcoin stalled just short of the $50,000 mark on Monday and other
cryptocurrencies slipped, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s took profit from a record-
breaking rally that is being driven by a worldwide shift in [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) and
public attitudes towards digital assets.

Bitcoin fell as much as 5.6% to $45,914 in Asian trading hours, after
having posting a record high of $49,714.66 on Sunday. Rival crypto
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) slid more than 8%, though both later pared some of those
losses.

The dip, for now, taps the brakes on a surge that has vaulted the
cryptocurrency from the fringes of finance to Wall Street, as big
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and large companies have begun to take the digital asset
seriously and started to buy a lot of it.

Bitcoin is up about 20% in the week since electric carmaker Tesla Inc
announced it had $1.5 billion in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and would accept the currency
as payment. It has gained more than 60% for the year to date and more
than 1,100% since last March.

> “There’s this unadulterated wave of big players (buying) that has
continued to push the price higher,” said Chris Weston, head of research
at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. “We might be seeing one or two big
funds just cashing out,” he said.

>

> “The big question is: OK, you want to buy the pullback, but how big is
the pullback that we are talking about?”

Lunar New Year holidays in Hong Kong and China also kept a lid on moves
in Asia, while a tweet from Tesla boss and crypto advocate Elon Musk
appeared to weigh on the price of dogecoin, which he had previously
promoted.

> “If major dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my
full support,” he tweeted.

Dogecoin, a dog-themed currency created as a joke has been volatile in
recent weeks owing to a number of Musk tweets referring to it.

It has dropped 18.3% to $0.0536 in the past 24 hours according to
CoinDesk. Ethereum last sat at $1,740, about 7% below last week’s record
high of $1,879.

## GO WEST

Bitcoin’s rise has a cryptocurrency that is still hardly used for
transactions on the verge of $50,000 - a far cry from software developer
Laszlo Hanyecz’s 2010 purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s.

But in contrast to previous speculative [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rallies, driven by
traders mostly in Asia, gains in the past few months have been driven by
a seismic shift in U.S. [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ attitude.

Tesla’s investment followed multimillion-dollar [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) purchases by
business software firm MicroStrategy and a number of Wall Street fund
managers, such as billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, sounding positive
on the asset.

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Morgan Stanley’s investment arm is
also weighing a bet on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Meanwhile, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has made strides toward being a medium of exchange,
with PayPal allowing customers to use [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at its merchants and
Mastercard preparing to permit cryptocurrency use across its vast
network.

Bank of NY Mellon last week said it formed a new unit to help clients
own and trade digital assets and Japanese financial conglomerate SBI
Holdings is in talks with foreign firms for its own crypto joint
venture.

> “In the crypto space, these institutions coming to the party are seen
as steps towards acceptable and possible usage,” said Michael McCarthy,
chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.

Bitcoin has been the most prominent beneficiary, he said, but price
moves in other cryptocurrencies - such as EOS, which has more than
doubled since late December according to CoinDesk - show that the door
remains open to rivals.

> “The race is on amongst those candidates,” he said.
