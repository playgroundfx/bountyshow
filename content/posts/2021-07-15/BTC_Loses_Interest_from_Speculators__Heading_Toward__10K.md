Bitcoin has once again walked through a minor crisis on the price
approaching $30k. That level has the potential to trigger an even
broader sell-off in the cryptocurrency market. The quick rebound
suggests that the bulls are willing and able to defend the critical
round level.

However, everything is not so simple, and one of the leading indicators
is trading volume. This is exactly where the situation is alarming, as
the trading volume has decreased significantly in recent months.  The
average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading volume is 76% lower than the levels when the price
peaked above $60K. How negative is this for the crypto market? Investors
and traders choose to stay out of the market, and attempts to buy back
the decline are incredibly cautious.

A triangle with downside resistance and horizontal support at $31.5K
continues to form on the chart. Though the bulls manage to push the
price away from the bottom of this figure time after time, the sell-off
episodes start from lower and lower levels. And this has fatal
consequences for the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price.

With their massive share of speculative capital, cryptocurrencies are
not characterised by periods of calm at high prices: rapid growth or a
deafening collapse followed by a consolidation. This dramatically
increases the odds that the exit from the consolidation phase will be
down with a potential $10k target at some point next year.

Yesterday, we saw that both when the price of the benchmark
cryptocurrency fell and when it rebounded, trading volume showed little
to no change. This means that the market was driven by small open
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) positions, indicating a deep vulnerability to the sentiment of
a small group. It is hard to see bullish forces accumulating in such a
situation to break through critical levels.

Elsewhere, despite local attacks against cryptocurrencies and exchanges
by authorities in developed economies, senior banking officials still
confirm that cryptocurrencies are not a system threat. Probably, that is
why we are not seeing a harsh reaction from regulators around the world.
For example, the Bank of England deputy governor said that
cryptocurrencies “have not yet crossed the financial stability risk
line”. It is widely recognised that cryptocurrencies are volatile.

Still, as long as monetary authorities in developed economies look at
digital currencies through the lens of a “technology casino,” crypto
market participants have time to make a profit before the size of the
market forces regulators to stop the free development of digital
currencies. That moment will probably coincide with the launch of
national digital currencies. For now, the “casino” works and
consistently win.
