![Bitcoin Dips Below $32K as Fed Rate-Hike Bets Rise, Gold Remains
Resilient][1]

Bitcoin extended Tuesday’s decline even as gold, a traditional inflation
hedge, remained resilient to increased bets that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will tighten its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sooner than previously
expected. The leading cryptocurrency was trading near $32,300 at press
time, a 1.4% drop on the day. Prices hit a 2 1/2-week low of $31,669
early today, having run into offers above $33,000 on Tuesday, CoinDesk
20 data show.

The drop to the lowest level since June 26 comes a day after futures
tied to the federal funds rate and eurodollars, which track short-term
interest-rate expectations, raised bets on Tuesday that the Fed would
increase interest rates between December 2022 and the first quarter of
2023. According to Reuters, the repricing happened after the U.S. Labor
Department said the consumer price index increased 5.4% year-over-year
in June, the fastest pace since 2008.Rate hikes, or possible tapering as
signaled by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard,
boost the attractiveness of holding fiat currencies, in this case the
dollar, and dilute the appeal of perceived store-of-value assets such as
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and gold.

However, while [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is nursing losses, gold is trading 0.35% higher
on the day at $1,814 an ounce. The discrepancy spurred Amber Group, a
crypto services provider, to call for caution in reading too much into
the rate-hike narrative for the time being. However, while [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has
come under pressure this week, it is still locked in the broad two-month
range of $30,000 to $40,000. “It’s hard to read too much into the price
action currently while we’re still stuck in this range,” Amber Group
said.
