As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price grinds toward $10,000, its performance over a much
longer timescale reached a significant milestone this month.

While most traders focus on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s spot price, zooming out on a more
extended timeframe reveals a bullish trend for the cryptocurrency. As
Twitter user The Moon points out, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s one-year average price just
reached an all-time high.

![Bitcoin is the Best-Performing Major Asset of 2020][1]

Based on The Moon’s analysis, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s 365-day moving average has
crossed $9,531.

This time last year, BTC was in the middle of a parabolic move that
would eventually take the price to a high near $14,000 in late June.

Then, just a few months ago, BTC crashed below $4,000 in a mass
coronavirus-driven liquidation event. Neither the upper end or lower
band of the yearly price range has been reached since.

Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving came and went on May 11, producing the
third “quantitative hardening” for the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network. Post-halving,
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miners now receive 6.25 BTC per block rather than the 12.5 BTC
they’ve grown accustomed to over the past four years.

With [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s inflation rate cut in half, proponents believe the
digital asset will become scarcer and thus more valuable. If [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) is
any indication, they’re probably right.

Although [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price tends to fall after the halving, the supply cut
is a significant tailwind over the next six-to-twelve months. Bullish
expectations are magnified by the number of new users joining the
network and the percentage holders who are simply accumulating and not
moving their BTC.

Data from Glassnode suggest [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) holders are taking matters into
their own hands by moving BTC out of exchanges and, possibly, into
hardware wallets. Bitcoin’s [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) active addresses and new addresses are
also on the rise.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price has rallied more than 12% since the halving took place
on Monday. Year-to-date, the price is up roughly 37%, making BTC the
best-performing major asset of 2020. By comparison, spot gold is up
14.2% over the same period.
