As Bitcoin markets begin to form another [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) red candle, its market
capitalization has dropped back below $1 trillion once again. The third
major correction in the current bull market is deepening and prices are
already down 12.5% from their all-time high of $60,100 on March 13.
According to CoinGecko, the BTC market capitalization is currently $980
billion, having dropped $140 billion over the past seven days since last
Thursday, March 18.

The move comes just a few days after analyst Willy Woo predicted that
its total capitalization would not fall back below these levels again.
“$1T is already strongly supported by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. I’d say there’s a fair
chance we’ll never see Bitcoin below $1T again.” The BTC market cap
first surpassed a trillion dollars on Feb. 19 but did not remain there
long, falling back below it after just four days. The second time it
topped ten figures was on March 9, and it remained above the milestone
level until today’s slump.

The total market capitalization for the entire crypto ecosystem is
currently $1.65 trillion according to CoinGecko. It has fallen by 9.8%,
or $180 billion since Monday, March 22. Profit taking could be a big
factor in this pullback, as suggested by analyst Josh Rager who stated
that unrealized profits are not realized until they are in the bank. In
reference to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor whose firm has been buying
a lot of Bitcoin this year, he added: “Don’t try to act like Saylor
won’t take profits eventually, cause he will along with every other fund
on the planet. Then they’ll buy back lower”
