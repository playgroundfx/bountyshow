They call it “max pain” in the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market: How to make one’s
trading counterparty suffer the most. Although the largest
cryptocurrency was changing hands Wednesday around $56,500, traders were
handicapping the odds of a plunge to about $44,000 by Friday, when a
record $6 billion of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) contracts is set to expire.

A drop to that price level would inflict “max pain” on buyers of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
contracts, and it might be the most profitable price point for [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
sellers. It’s a remote risk, but not one to be discounted. The max pain
theory states that the market will gravitate toward the pain point while
heading into the expiry. That’s because sellers – typically institutions
or sophisticated traders with ample capital supply – often try to push
the price toward the max pain point by buying or selling the asset on
spot or futures markets.

> The bullish spin is that if [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) makes it through Friday without a
major correction, a major overhang will be lifted. “Max pain for the
March 26 expiry is currently $44,000 on Deribit,” Luuk Strijers, CCO of
Deribit, the world’s largest crypto [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) exchange by trading volumes
and open positions, told CoinDesk. “That does not mean the market will
move to $44,000 by the end of this week, but it does imply that after
Friday this potential downward pressure no longer exists.”

Max pain is calculated by adding the outstanding put and call dollar
value of each in-the-money (ITM) strike price. An ITM call is one where
the strike price is below the spot market price, while a put is
considered ITM when the spot market price is below the put option’s
strike price. A potential unwinding of trades as Friday’s expiry
approaches may inject some volatility into the market, according to
Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of Delta Exchange.
