Bitcoin (BTC) saw its biggest negative difficulty adjustment in almost
10 years on Nov. 3 as the network flawlessly takes care of itself. Data
from monitoring resource BTC.com shows that the Bitcoin difficulty
automatically readjusted by 16% on Tuesday.

Estimates had previously suggested that the adjustment would be around
13%, but it was the second-highest in Bitcoin’s [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Only in 2011
was there a larger difference — 18%, which also came at the end of
October. Difficulty adjustments happen automatically every 2016 blocks,
and allow Bitcoin to remain as “hard” money regardless of any external
factors impacting miners.

Such a reduction incentivizes more mining participants to compete for
block subsidy rewards, with the result that the difficulty then begins
to rise again. At press time, however, estimates put the next adjustment
at another -16%, indicating that the effect of Tuesday’s event had not
yet been felt. For users, the downward adjustment will reduce fees and
decrease block times, along with reducing the size of unmined
transactions in Bitcoin’s mempool. According to estimates from Earn.com,
the optimal Bitcoin transaction fee remains high, at 80,000 satoshis
($11).

Commentators appeared only a little fazed, instead praising Satoshi
Nakamoto’s design for protecting network and funds integrity. Meanwhile,
Bitcoin’s network hash rate appeared to be u-turning on its own descent
Tuesday, with estimated weekly average values beginning to trend up.
