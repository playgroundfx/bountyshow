The monthly candle of Bitcoin (BTC) for October has closed above $13,000
for the first time since December 2017. It comes after both [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and
weekly candles all closed above the crucial resistance level. Traders
often use the monthly log chart to evaluate the long-term and macro
trend of an asset. On a monthly chart, each candle represents a whole
month of trading activity. As such, a Bitcoin monthly log chart
typically covers many years of trading activity.

The monthly chart is considered to be one of the main high time frame
charts alongside the weekly chart. A clear breakout above an important
level, like $13,000, on the monthly chart, indicates a technical
breakout. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood
emphasized the importance of the $13,000 level.

Wood, who manages $11 billion in assets under management at Ark Invest,
said there is little resistance between $13,000 and $20,000. This means
if Bitcoin breaks out on a high time frame chart, the probability to
rise to a new record-high could get higher. She said:

“That $13,000 [level] is important because if we were to get through
that, then in technical [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), there would be very little resistance and
we would probably be on our way back to the peaks we saw in late 2017 —
so, around $20,000. Now, we’re not sure if that is going to happen. We
could stay in a new trading range, just at a little bit of a higher
level than the recent six to 10. Maybe we’re in the $10,000 to $13,000
range. Nonetheless, a breakout.”

Although the price of Bitcoin hit $20,000 in 2017 and $13,970 in 2019,
the monthly candle never closed above $13,000. This is because BTC saw
sharp rejections during both peaks, which then rattled the market.

The recent rally is particularly optimistic because it has shown a more
sustainable staircase-like uptrend. As the price rose, it established
clear support levels, making the rally more stable.

What do traders expect in the near term?  
In the immediate future, traders are readying for a minor pullback.
Technically, the monthly chart of Bitcoin closed significantly higher
above key short-term moving averages.
