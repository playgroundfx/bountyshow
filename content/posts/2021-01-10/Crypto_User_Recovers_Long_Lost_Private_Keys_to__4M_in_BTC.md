A student has claimed to have found private keys accidentally HODLed
starting as early as 2011 which will unlock more than $4 million in
Bitcoin. According to a throwaway account from BitcoinHolderThankU, the
Reddit user was able to cash out roughly $4.2 million in Bitcoin (BTC)
after finding the lost keys to 127 BTC on Dec. 22, when the price of the
crypto asset was in the $23,000s. They later liquidated the coins in the
middle of the bull run.

> “I spent the next week figuring out [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) safely and securely
liquidate such a large amount of Bitcoin for the cheapest price
possible,” said the Redditor. “I went back and forth between different
[over-the-counter principal desks] and ultimately ended up selling all
127 Bitcoins for a price of $33,439.02 per coin minus a 0.15% fee. The
net was roughly $4.24 million.”

They claim to have earned Bitcoin in 2011 or 2012 through “surveys,
watching videos, and completing random tasks” to ultimately use the
coins for purchasing in-game currency for the online game DarkOrbit. The
private keys were reportedly never really missing, just forgotten on an
older model Dell computer as BitcoinHolderThankU ended up not purchasing
the currency.

Unfortunately, if the Redditor’s account is to be believed, they missed
out on $1 million in additional profit by not holding for just a few
more weeks. Since December, the price of Bitcoin has passed $41,000 to
reach new all-time highs. BitcoinHolderThankU admitted they “would not
have sold all 127 Bitcoin” if the same situation had played out again.
“To give myself credit, I did HODL for 8-9 years which is more than the
vast majority of crypto users,” they said. “I definitely would’ve done
things differently if I were given a second chance.”
