Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission vetoed
two proposals to offer [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded funds, dealing a blow to
market participants who had hoped the agency would green light the
effort after approving futures-backed [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) funds in October.

In a notice dated Wednesday, the markets regulator said both of the
proposals to list and trade shares of Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund and the
Kryptoin Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) Trust failed to be approved because they did not
meet its standard.

> "(These proposals) do not meet the standard of being designed to
prevent [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the public interest,” the SEC said.

The SEC in October approved two [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures-based funds, the
ProShares Bitcoin Strategy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/),
which made their Wall Street debuts the same month.

However, the regulator has yet to accept an application for a spot
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/). Last month, the SEC rejected an application to create a
spot [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) fund from VanEck, and on Dec. 17, delayed a decision on a
similar proposal from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s are investment tools that track baskets of stocks and have become
popular due to their lower fees. A Bitcoin [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/), which provides exposure
to the digital currency, aims to save the hassle of buying the
cryptocurrency from an exchange and managing the private keys.

Industry groups and stock exchanges have long sought to gain approval
from the SEC on these products.

Democratic SEC Chair Gary Gensler and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) advocates, however, worry
about what they see as a lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance
which heightens the potential for [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) and manipulation, they have
said.
