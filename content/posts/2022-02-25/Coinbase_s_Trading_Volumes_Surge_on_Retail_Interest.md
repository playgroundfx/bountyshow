Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Coinbase Global IncÂ on
Thursday reported a surge in quarterly trading volumes on a sequential
basis as volatility in prices drew in retail traders, but warned that
growth would slow in the current quarter.

Trading volumes jumped more than 67% to $547 billion in the quarter
ended Dec. 31, with retail trading accounting for 32% of volumes and
crypto assets contributing 68% to total trading.

> "The sequential increase in retail Trading Volume was driven primarily
by higher levels of volatility as well as strong consumer interest in a
wider variety of crypto assets," the company said in a statement.

Crypto exchanges have benefited from the digital assets' march to the
mainstream, with businesses across the globe investing heavily to ramp
up their crypto infrastructure.

But prices of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) - the world's largest cryptocurrency - have
weakened in recent months as global central banks signal the end of
their pandemic-era stimulus.

The original cryptocurrency has also suffered due to rising geopolitical
tensions and slumped to a one-month low on Thursday after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine sparked a global selloff.

Coinbase said it believes that retail monthly transacting users and
total trading volume will both be lower in the current quarter as
compared with the final quarter of 2021.

Coinbase, one of the largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s in the world, went
public through a direct listing in April.
