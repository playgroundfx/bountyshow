Bitcoin’s price climbed above $15,000 on Thursday, hitting a level not
seen since January 2018 amid U.S. presidential election uncertainty. The
world’s best-known cryptocurrency was last trading almost 9% higher at a
price of $15,233, according to data from industry [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) CoinDesk.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2020, more than doubling in value year-to-
date. Its meteoric rise comes on the back of unprecedented stimulus from
global governments and central banks during the coronavirus pandemic,
which some industry insiders believe has made the virtual currency more
attractive than fiat currencies like the dollar.

Investors are awaiting the latest monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement from the
Federal Reserve, with the U.S. central bank expected to keep overnight
rates close to zero and reiterate the need for more fiscal stimulus. But
lingering uncertainty over the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential
election means that it’s unlikely another coronavirus stimulus package
will be agreed upon in the near term.

Meanwhile, analysts have cheered moves from the likes of PayPal and
Facebook in the cryptocurrency space lately. PayPal said it would let
its customers buy and sell digital assets like [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether through
its digital wallet and eventually use them for shopping, while Facebook
is developing its [Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/) digital currency with a Switzerland-based
consortium called the Libra Association.

Still, regulators continue to scrutinize the cryptocurrency industry.
Bitcoin’s network doesn’t require a central authority to maintain it,
and officials have expressed concern with its use in illicit
transactions. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice said it had
seized $1 billion worth of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) believed to be linked to Silk Road,
the now-defunct online black market.
