Bitcoin has just powered up to its highest price since January 8, 2018,
knocking on the door of $16,000 as FOMO grips the markets once again. In
a move upwards that has added more than 12% over the past 24 hours,
Bitcoin prices touched their highest levels for 33 months reaching
$15,980 during early trading in Asia today, November 6, according to
Tradingview.com.

The $16K level may form resistance since there were two weekly closes at
$16,100 in early January 2018 so if this week’s candle can hold on to
these levels, there could be a push higher towards that elusive all-time
high. Chart patterns are currently reminiscent of those in late November
2017 when BTC made a rapid push from $7K to top $16K in just three
weeks.

Analysts have noted that the price of Bitcoin is now 80% of its all-time
high, the closest it has ever been to full recovery, which has only
taken 12 days on average from these levels to ATH [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly. On the
flip side, traders may start to take some profit here which could result
in a pullback.

The ‘Fear and Greed Index’ is currently cranked over into the ‘extreme
greed’ zone at 90. The last time it was this high was in June 2019 when
it reached 92 as Bitcoin powered to its highest price for that year at
just under $14K.

The U.S. election results may have been the catalyst for this week’s
rally as Joe Biden extends his lead over Donald Trump with the counting
almost concluded. At the time of press, Biden was leading by 264 to 214
in the race to 270 with just five states left to go. Square has also
just reported record breaking revenue and profit from Bitcoin sales on
its Cash App.
