Ethereum (ETH) has hit multiple records amid [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that ETH 2.0 could
launch as early as Dec 1, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode.

Today’s launch of the deposit contract introduced the ability for users
to deposit 32 Ether required to participate in staking. ETH 2.0’s beacon
chain genesis will take place on Dec. 1 if at least 16,384 deposits of
32 ETH each are received. That’s a total of 524,288 ETH, or about $200
million worth.

Hours after the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) was published, the number of Ethereum addresses
holding at least 32 Ethereum hit an all-time high (ATH) of 126,852.
Prior to the latest rise, this figure had hovered around 123k since June
this year, with fluctuations only in the hundreds of addresses.

This means that around 13% of all addresses currently holding more than
32 Ether will need to participate in order to launch staking. Should
this amount not be met, the launch will be postponed until seven days
after the threshold is hit.

The number of addresses holding at least 0.1, 10, or 100 Ether has also
risen to post record highs of 3,616,246 addresses, 293,183 addresses,
and 52,943 addresses, respectively — indicating increased accumulation
from speculators as well as prospective validators.
