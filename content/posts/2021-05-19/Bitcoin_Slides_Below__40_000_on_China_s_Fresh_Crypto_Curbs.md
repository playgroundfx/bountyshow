Bitcoin tumbled below the $40,000 mark on Wednesday hitting a 3-1/2
month low and dragging down other digital coins after China imposed
fresh curbs on transactions involving cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, had already been
under pressure from a series of tweets from Tesla boss Elon Musk but the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from China sent it as low as $38,514, for a 9% fall.

The coin is now down 40% from a record high of $64,895 hit on April 14.
It is also heading for its first monthly decline since November 2018.

Bitcoin’s moves hit other crypto assets too, with Ether, the coin linked
to the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network, falling 15% to $2,875.36, while
meme-based dogecoin tumbled 18%, according to market tracker Coingecko.

Frankfurt-listed shares in crypto exchange Coinbase slumped 6%, having
already dipped below their direct listing price of $250 earlier in the
week.

The crypto declines were sparked last week by Musk’s reversal on Tesla
accepting [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as payment. His subsequent tweets caused further
confusion over whether the carmaker had shed its holdings of the coin.

Selling was exacerbated by China’s announcement banning financial
institutions and payment companies from providing services related to
cryptocurrency transactions. It also warned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s against
speculative crypto trading.

Cryptowatchers predicted more losses ahead, noting the fall below
$40,000 represented a breach of a key technical barrier which could set
the stage for more selling.

More importantly, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may be shifting from [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) back to gold,
analysts at JPMorgan said, citing positioning data compiled on basis of
open interest in CME [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures contracts.

This shows “the steepest and more sustained liquidation” in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
futures since last October, they told clients, adding: “the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) flow
picture continues to deteriorate and is pointing to continued
retrenchment by institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.”

The selloff in crypto assets precisely at a time when inflation fears
are in the ascendancy dashes any suggestion of the asset class being an
inflation hedge.

Instead, more traditional hedges have been gaining ground, with gold up
almost 6% so far this month.

The recent selloff in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other digital currencies has taken
market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies back under $2 trillion,
down from the recent $2.5 trillion record.
