A hedge fund specializing in volatility bets has emerged as one of the
largest [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in Bitcoin after quietly buying more than $600 million
in cryptocurrencies and joining forces with Alan Howard, the co-founder
of Brevan Howard Asset Management.

Eric Peters, chief executive officer of One River Asset Management, said
in an interview he set up a new company to seize on the growing interest
in cryptocurrencies among institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. In addition to its
initial purchases, One River Digital Asset Management has commitments
that will bring its holdings of Bitcoin and Ether to about $1 billion as
of early 2021, he said.

A surge in [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s and unprecedented monetary-[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) moves
are increasingly attracting big money to an area that had largely been
the realm of retail bettors. Bitcoin surpassed $20,000 Wednesday to hit
a record and has almost tripled in price this year.

Another [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) with One River Digital is Ruffer LLP, the U.K.
investment firm known for its bets on market volatility. Ruffer on
Tuesday disclosed a 2.5% position in Bitcoin in one of its funds,
describing it as “a small but potent insurance [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) against the
continuing devaluation of the world’s major currencies.”
