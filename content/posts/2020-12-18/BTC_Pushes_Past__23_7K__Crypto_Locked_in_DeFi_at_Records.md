![Bitcoin Pushes Past $23.7K While Crypto Locked in DeFi at All-Time
High][1]

The price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) continued its rise to all-time highs, going up to
$23,770 as of press time in a highly bullish run that had lots of
volume-fueled momentum.

The $23,800 level may be a spot of exhaustion for the world’s oldest
cryptocurrency, according to Constantin Kogan, partner at financial firm
Wave Financial. “There’s some strong selling resistance at $23,800.
Let’s see if [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) can break it,” Kogan told CoinDesk.

Volumes on Thursday were higher than on Wednesday, with the eight major
exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 seeing over $3.5 billion in volume
so far as of press time versus $2.9 billion the day previous.

> “Breaking the $20,000 psychological barrier was a strong bullish
signal allowing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to set a new record high,” said Elie Le Rest,
partner at crypto quant trading firm ExoAlpha. However, Le Rest
cautioned about crypto’s classic gyrations possibly affecting the
market. “Volatility is very high and small pullbacks have been witnessed
along the way.” Indeed, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s 30-day volatility has been picking up
and will be something to watch over the balance of December.

The amount of crypto “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is at
$16 billion as of press time, increasing over 2,200% from the $690
million locked at the start of 2020.
