Bitcoin is down 0.4% over the past 24 hours to $40.7K. Ethereum has
added 1.5% over the same time, other leading altcoins from the top ten
are changing from -2.0% (Terra) to 5% (Avalanche).

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, grew by 0.3% over the day, to $1.83 trillion. The Bitcoin
dominance index decreased by 0.4% to 42.4% due to the better dynamics of
altcoins.

The crypto-currency index of fear and greed lost 2 points to 25 in a day
and again found itself in a state of “extreme fear”.

Despite the outstripping dynamics of altcoins, a sequence of lower and
lower local highs continues to form in Bitcoin. In early February, the
upside lost momentum as it moved above $45.5K. In the first days of
March, the bears already dominated on the way to $45K, on the 8th
already near $42.5K, and in the last two days, they are trying to form a
downward reversal at $41.5K. At the same time, the bulls manage to form
strong support near $38K.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of technical analysis, BTCUSD remains close to its 50-day
moving average, clearly indicating the absence of any trend now.
However, consolidation in a descending triangle is usually a respite
before the next decline. We will see the implementation of this scenario
if BTCUSD fixes under $38K. An alternative scenario and a new upside
momentum should be expected if the bulls manage to push the price above
the previous highs of $42.5K, or close the day/week above $42K.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, known for his bullish predictions,
has unveiled a new one that sees BTC hit $500,000 in 2025.

According to the Santiment team, Bitcoin whale activity has fallen to
its lowest level in a year in recent days. Therefore, one should not
expect sharp movements in the market soon.
