Bitcoin is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours to $41K. Ethereum added
4.7% to $2.75K, while Terra is out of the range, losing 0.6% in 24
hours, and other leading altcoins from the top ten add from 3.5% (XRP)
to 9.8% (Avalanche).

According to Glassnode, $1.2 billion worth of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was withdrawn from
the Coinbase crypto exchange in just a week. This is the largest net
outflow since July 2017, which signals the mood of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for long-
term storage of the asset.

Despite the positive dynamics in recent days, Bitcoin has been trading
in a sideways range between $37K and $42K for almost the entire month of
March, unable to choose a further direction. Since the last days of
February, there has been a solid support line on the declines under
$38K. And this is bullish strength, reflecting that long-term buyer
interest has migrated from $30K to $38K due to inflation and
geopolitical tensions.

Such a migration of the level of interest to long-term buyers fully
reflects the price jump, which is the actual depreciation of the value
of fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, Instagram will implement NFT in a couple of months, Meta
founder Mark Zuckerberg said. Despite the loud statement, it should be
noted that all of Zuckerbergâ€™s projects related to digital assets
previously failed and did not find wide support from the digital
community. The head of Meta has a good sense of trends of social
networks, augmented reality or metaverses, and in the latter two, there
are more and more fast-growing projects.
