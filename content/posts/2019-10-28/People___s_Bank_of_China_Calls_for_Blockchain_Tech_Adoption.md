By the way, the central bank of China is actually developing its own
digital yuan, which as it is expected to be launched in the nearest
time. The working process on its own currency was triggered by [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about Facebook’s Libra project.

This [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about China’s plans pushed the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices up by more than
16 percent the prior day, to touch the border more than $9,900. So, the
wide-spread cryptocurrency gained over the weekend by near ⅓.

One should also keep in mind, that not so long ago China had completely
opposite opinion. This fact had repeatedly drew the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices down.

As for the cryptocurrency rates for Monday, they are as follows:

  * Bitcoin eased by 2.48 percent, to $9373;

  * Ethereum slipped by 1.96 percent, to $182.85;

  * Ripple lost 0.53 percent, to $0.2966;

  * Bitcoin Cash added 0.91 percent, to $265.70;

  * Litecoin descended by 3.91 percent, to $58,27 at 13.42 GMT.
