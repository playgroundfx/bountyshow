![Mining Difficulty Expected to Increase for the First Time Since China
Crackdown][1]

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty may be set to increase for the first time
since China’s crackdown on crypto mining in May. A rapid expansion of
mining facilities in North America and the return of Chinese miners
through overseas hosting sites are two major factors that will drive up
mining difficulty, according to industry pros.

Mining difficulty is a metric to describe how hard it is to mine a block
and get rewards in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). An increase in mining difficulty requires a
miner to use more computing power to earn [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which reduces the
miner’s profit margin. The more mining machines are online, the higher
the mining difficulty and the more secure the Bitcoin network.

Mining difficulty has seen a continuous decrease since the Chinese
central government called for local authorities to shut off [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
mining operations across the country on May 21. The latest bi-weekly
difficulty level posted on July 17 is the fourth downward adjustment
since the crackdown.

Even before China’s crackdown, big North American mining companies such
as Marathon and Riot were already expanding their operations due to
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s historic bull run in early 2021, Luxor CEO Nick Hansen said.
Most of the growth that will drive up mining difficulty in the coming
months would still be from the North American miners who planned
expansion ahead of Beijing’s crackdown last year or in early 2021,
Daniel Frumkin, researcher at Prague-based mining company Slush Pool,
said.
