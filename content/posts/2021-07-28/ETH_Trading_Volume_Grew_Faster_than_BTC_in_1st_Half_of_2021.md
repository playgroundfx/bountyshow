![ETH’s trading volume grew much faster than BTC’s in first half of
2021][1]

The world’s second-largest crypto asset has gained ground on Bitcoin in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trading volume growth during the first half of this year
according to a new report. Ethereum’s trading volume grew faster than
Bitcoin’s in the first half of this year according to a new report from
leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase. The Coinbase Institutional H1
2021 in Review report, released on July 26, acknowledged that the first
half of this year has been one of the most active periods on record for
crypto, with several new all-time highs in prices, user adoption, and
trading activity.

Taking data from twenty exchanges across the globe, the report revealed
that the trading volume for Bitcoin reached $2.1 trillion for the
period, up 489% from $356 billion over the first half of last year.
Ethereum’s total trading volume reached $1.4 trillion, but its growth
was much faster, up 1,461% from $92 billion in the first half of 2020.
Coinbase remarked that it has been the first sustained period of time
ever that Ethereum’s trading pace exceeded Bitcoin’s.

The research also measured total crypto market capitalization, which
began the year at $769 billion, peaked at $2.4 trillion in May, and
ended the period at $1.4 trillion, registering a net gain of 86% year to
date. It noted that the bulk of BTC’s gains came during Q4 2020 and Q1
2021, before the crypto asset’s price declined in Q2 2021. It is
currently trading down 38.8% from its April 13 all-time high of $65,899.
