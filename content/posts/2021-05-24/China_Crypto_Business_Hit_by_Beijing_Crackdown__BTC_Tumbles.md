SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Cryptocurrency miners, including HashCow and
BTC.TOP, have halted all or part of their China operations after Beijing
intensified a crackdown on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining and trading, hammering digital
currencies amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.

A State Council committee led by Vice Premier Liu He announced the
crackdown late on Friday as part of efforts to fend off financial risks.
It was the first time China's cabinet has targeted virtual currency
mining, a sizable business in the world's second-biggest economy that
some estimates say accounts for as much as 70% of the global crypto
supply.

Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi on Monday suspended both crypto-mining and
some trading services to new clients from mainland China, adding it will
instead focus on overseas businesses.

BTC.TOP, a crypto mining pool, also announced the suspension of its
China business citing regulatory risks, while crypto miner HashCow said
it would halt buying new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining rigs.

Crypto miners use increasingly powerful, specially-designed computer
equipment, or rigs, to verify virtual coin transactions in a process
which produces newly minted crypto currencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

> "Crypto mining consumes a lot of energy, which runs counter to China's
carbon neutrality goals," said Chen Jiahe, chief investment officer of
Beijing-based family office Novem Arcae Technologies.

The crackdown is also part of China's stepped-up drive to curb
speculative crypto trading, he added.

Bitcoin took a beating after the latest Chinese move, and is now down
nearly 50% from it's all-time high. It shed as much as 17% on Sunday,
before paring some losses and was last trading steady in Asia.
Elsewhere, Ether fell to a two-month low on Sunday, down 60% from a
record peak hit just 12 days ago,

Investor protection and money laundering are particular concerns of
global financial regulators who are grappling with whether and how they
should regulate the cryptocurrency industry.

The latest shakeout in digital currencies also stems from tighter
scrutiny in the United States. Last Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Jerome Powell said they pose risks to financial stability, and
indicating that greater [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of the increasingly popular
electronic currency may be warranted.

> "Huobi always strives to abide by the evolving policies and
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s of each jurisdiction," Huobi said in a statement to Reuters.

BTC.TOP founder Jiang Zhuoer said in a micro blog post via Weibo that
its mining business will no longer be open to mainland China, while
HashCow said it would suspend new businesses in China in a notice to
clients. BTC.TOP and HashCow could not be immediately reached for
comment

DIRTY BUSINESS

The annual energy consumption of China's cryptocurrency miners is
expected to peak in 2024 at about 297 terawatt-hours, greater than all
the power consumption by Italy in 2016, according to a study recently
published in scientific journal Nature Communications.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged carbon neutrality by 2060.

China has already lost its position as a global cryptocurrency trading
centre after Beijing banned crypto exchanges in 2017.

> "Eventually, China will lose crypto computing power to foreign markets
as well," BTC.TOP founder Jiang wrote, predicting the rise of U.S. and
European mining pools.

Chen of Novem Arcae said the crypto craze, if not curbed, could turn
into froth similar to the Dutch tulipmania in the 17th century - often
regarded as the first financial bubble in recorded [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

> "The only difference is that after the tulip bubble burst, there were
still some beautiful flowers left," Chen said.

>

> "But when the virtual currency bubble bursts, what would be left are
merely some computer codes."
