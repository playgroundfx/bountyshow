Today, the United States Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will give a
speech on the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Contrary to expectations, it might
not have any major impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC). The markets are
seemingly expecting the Fed to showcase significant changes to its
policies. Some strategists said the Fed might allow inflation to run
higher than 2% to offset the slowing economy.

If that happens, in the medium to long term, it could be a catalyst for
safe-haven assets such as gold and potentially Bitcoin, given their
tight correlation in recent months.

However, Tom Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, hinted
the market might not show an immense reaction. Investors are somewhat
aware of what Powell is expected to say at the Jackson Hole conference.
Many analysts anticipate the Fed to maintain low-interest rates for the
foreseeable future and possibly let inflation run higher.

Theoretically, given that inflation could damage the value of the U.S.
dollar, it would subsequently benefit gold and Bitcoin. Yet, both gold
and Bitcoin have been stagnant over the past week, while the U.S. stock
market has rallied.

Graff thinks that the Fed will have to demonstrate its willingness to
undergo a major [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rethink through its actions. Until then, the
strategist said the market would struggle to believe the Fed. He
emphasized that the Fed lacks credibility among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which might
affect the market’s response to the symposium. Graff explained:

The market’s skepticism towards Powell’s speech explains the continuous
decline of the price of gold. Since achieving a new record high at
$2,075 on Aug. 6, gold fell by around 6.5% to $1,940.

Winklevoss suggests higher inflation is positive for Bitcoin  
Over the long term, avid Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and industry executives
foresee low interest rates and higher inflation as a catalyst for
Bitcoin’s price to move higher.

Tyler Winklevoss, a billionaire Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) and the co-founder of
Gemini, said the Fed has been Bitcoin’s biggest “booster.” He said:

> “The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be
Bitcoin’s biggest booster. On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about
how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.”

Referring to the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium, Bill Barhydt, the CEO of
Abra, said the Fed is fueling the sentiment around Bitcoin. He added:

> “Bitcoin doesn’t need the Fed to succeed but if they insist on
throwing gasoline on the fire then so be it.”
