Bitcoin soared on Wednesday to touch an all-time high, as the
cryptocurrency continued trading wildly.

![Bitcoin Soars Above $35,000, Hitting new High][1]

The price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rallied to trade above $35,000 as of about 2:11
a.m. EST Wednesday, according to data from Coin Metrics. The price surge
came just days after it slumped more than 10% to $29,316. That followed
a more than 300% jump in 2020 to levels above $29,000. On Monday,
JPMorgan published a note with a bold long-term price target for
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), claiming the cryptocurrency could soar to as high as $146,000
as it competes with gold as an “alternative” currency. The precious
metal also saw sizable gains in 2020, with spot gold rising about 25%
for the year.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder and co-managing partner of SkyBridge
Capital, also told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Wednesday that his
firm is “quite bullish” on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s store of value and sees it
“replacing” gold. Scaramucci, a former White House communications
director, added that Democratic control of Congress would be “great” for
cryptocurrencies due to expectations of “tremendous” money printing
under a federal government controlled by the party.
