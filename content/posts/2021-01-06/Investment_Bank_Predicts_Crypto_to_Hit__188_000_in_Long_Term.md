One of the world’s largest investment banks has theorised that
cryptocurrency Bitcoin could reach as high as US$146,000 ($188,430), but
it won’t happen in 2021. In a research note, JPMorgan & Chase analysts
claimed that as money from traditional gold investments flowed to
Bitcoin, the two would compete for investment capital.

With Bitcoin as an alternative “safe haven” to gold, the analysts gave
Bitcoin a long-term price scenario of US$146,000.

But the crypto’s recent rally – which has seen it push to record highs –
may still have some more legs before retreating. “The valuation and
position backdrop has become a lot more challenging for Bitcoin at the
beginning of the New Year,” the research note states.

> “While we cannot exclude the possibility that the current speculative
mania will propagate further pushing the Bitcoin price up toward the
consensus region of between $50,000-$100,000, we believe that such price
levels would prove unsustainable.”
