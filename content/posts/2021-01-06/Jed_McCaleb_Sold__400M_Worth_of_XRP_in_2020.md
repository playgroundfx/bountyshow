Stellar CTO and Ripple architect Jed McCaleb cashed out a whopping $411
million in XRP in 2020, according to an updated report from [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
analytics account Whale Alert. McCaleb sold 1.2 billion XRP throughout
the year at an average price of $0.34 per coin — amassing close to half
a billion dollars. The sum reportedly represents 27% of McCaleb’s XRP
stash that is held in a settlement account with Ripple Labs, and marks a
sharp acceleration of his sales to date. He sold roughly one billion XRP
in the five years between 2014 and 2019.

By Whale Alert’s estimations, the combined value of McCaleb’s current
and liquidated XRP holdings is approximately $1.2 billion, placing him
high on crypto’s rich list. McCaleb also appears to have timed his sales
well, with Ripple currently facing lawsuits from both the SEC and from a
major [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who participated in the firm’s $200 million Series C
funding round in 2019.

McCaleb controversially received a co-founders reward of 9.5 billion XRP
when he left Ripple Labs in 2014. During the same year, McCaleb signed
an agreement with Ripple Labs that limited the amount of XRP he can sell
per week in order to avoid negative pressure on the market. Despite
receiving widespread criticism, McCaleb has repeatedly sought to assure
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that his selling has not impacted the price of XRP. McCaleb’s
agreement with Ripple Labs comes to an end in 2023.
