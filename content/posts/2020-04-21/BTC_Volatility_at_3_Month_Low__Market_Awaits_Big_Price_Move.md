The spread between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s Bollinger bands – volatility indicators
placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving price
average – narrowed to $895 on Monday. That’s the lowest level since Jan.
6, when the spread was $636, according to Bitstamp data. Bitcoin has
spent a better part of the last two weeks trading the range of
$6,450–$7,450, with the range further narrowing to $7,000–$7,300 since
Thursday.

The tightening of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) is widely considered to be an advanced
indicator of an impending big move. “When it tightens, it is because we
have been consistently trading in a narrower range for a prolonged
period and we should see a breakout very soon,” said Chris Thomas, head
of digital assets at Swissquote.

As can be seen, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price volatility has exploded following
previous tight ranges in October 2019 and January 2020. Other volatility
indicators have also witnessed a sharp drop over the last few weeks. For
example, the Bollinger bandwidth, which is calculated by dividing the
gap between the bands by the 20-day moving average, is seen at 0.13 at
press time, having risen from 0.11 to 0.90 (high volatility) in the
first three weeks of March.

Historically, a reading below 0.10 has marked an end of price
consolidation or low-volatility environment. So with the metric
currently at 0.13, we might see [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trade without clear directional
bias for a few more days. Meanwhile, the volatility situation in the
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market looks to have normalized, as one-month implied
volatility is now hovering below its average level of 77 percent,
according to data provided by crypto derivatives firm Skew.

The cryptocurrency fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and hit a low
of $3,867 on the following day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price
Index. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, crashed by
35 percent in the four weeks to March 24, pushing the volatility (VIX)
index higher from 20 percent to 86 percent. As of Friday, the S&P was
reporting over 25 percent gains from lows seen on March 24, while the
VIX index was hovering around 41.

Uncertainty in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets has declined
over the past couple of weeks, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s
open-ended asset purchase program and the U.S. government’s massive
fiscal stimulus worth trillions of dollars.

However, markets are not out of the woods yet because the number of
coronavirus cases is still rising globally. The coronavirus death toll
in the U.S. crossed 40,000 over the weekend with over 744,000
infections, raising doubts over the nation’s readiness to reopen its
economy. Further, oil prices crashed close to a two-decade low below $16
early Monday on concerns of high inventory buildup in the U.S. As a
result, equity markets could come under pressure, pushing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) lower.

Put simply, the low-volatility period could end with a downside move,
more so as miner-led selling pressure for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is currently high,
according to crypto asset analytics company Coin Metrics. On the
downside, major support is seen around $6,450, the lower end of the
recent trading range.
