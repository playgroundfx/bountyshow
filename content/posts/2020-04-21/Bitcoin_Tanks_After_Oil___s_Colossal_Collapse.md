Bitcoin was in for a surprise plunge this Monday as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s assessed
the situation in a worrisome oil market. The benchmark cryptocurrency
fell by 4.30 percent to circa $6,748 per token shortly after the US oil
futures price slipped into negative territory for the first time. The
two assets remain non-correlated, but [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s growing correspondence
to the stock market amid the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic might
have led its prices to decline.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.4 percent to 23650.44 on
Monday, taking cues from the oil market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq
Composite, too, plunged by 1.8 percent and 1 percent, respectively,
showing that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continued to seek safety away from risk-on
assets.

Bitcoin’s intraday fall did not stop its prices from holding its
prevailing uptrend. The cryptocurrency plunged right into what appears
like its interim support before attempting a minor pullback heading into
the Asian session Tuesday. As shown in the Coinbase 1D chart above,
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) tested the upward sloping support trendline of the saffroned
Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency bounced back weakly by 1.01
percent to hit an intraday high near $6,925, expressing its likelihood
to consolidate further in the current resistance range defined by
$6,800-lows and $7,500-highs.

Meanwhile, the price located converging support in the blue 50-[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
moving average wave. Bulls attempted to maintain [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s interim
upside bias near these support levels, confirming that they still have a
technical advantage against a dwindling macroeconomic outlook. Bitcoin’s
growing proximity with the US stocks remains one of the most alarming
downside catalysts. The oil shock could send equities further down as
the week matures. Meanwhile, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s looking to neutralize their
losses could start selling the first profitable thing they see for cash.
That is troubling for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), which has surged 77 percent from its
cycle low. Bulls’ next objective is to maintain support above $6,800.
The floor could lead the prices as up as $9,000, as predicted in one of
Bitcoinist earlier analyses.
