While Coinbase platform and other well-known exchanges see perspective
in its market, the most part of digital currency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s still rely on
shaky exchanges to buy, sell and trade.

The cryptocurrency trading market is going strong, despite the threat,
which bares the exchanges with less than stellar reputations because of
regulatory compliance and data security issues, that are still lagging
there. And these middling exchanges still get lion’s share of crypto
trades.

Besides the fact, the crypto sector is rapidly gaining ground, there is
still the alarming data, according to Cryptocurrency data and indices
provider CryptoCompare, which presented a report regarding the market’s
reliance on what is considered “low-quality” exchanges.

While some of the industry’s ultimate exchanges, as for example Coinbase
and Poloniex are, show significant gains in crypto market in July, less-
reputable or simply small exchanges with ratings of “D” or “F” hold
approximately more than 60 percent of traded value.

For example, the San Francisco-based Coinbase with a CryptoCompare’s
highest rating of “AA” has  much less trading volume than a “D” graded
platform LBank, which sees on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis trades in 15 times more,
than a trustworthy Coinbase.

Ratings of companies providing services on the cryptocurrency market are
based on indicators such as the geographical location of the exchange,
the presence of legislative and regulatory requirements, the quality of
the team and services of the company, including the quality of the data
provided.
