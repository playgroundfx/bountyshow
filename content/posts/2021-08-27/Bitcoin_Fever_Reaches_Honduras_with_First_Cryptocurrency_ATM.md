Aug 27 (Reuters) - The first cryptocurrency ATM in Honduras opened this
week as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) backers sought to spur demand for virtual assets after
neighboring El Salvador became the first country to establish [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as
legal tender.

The machine, locally dubbed “la [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)era,” allows users to acquire
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) using the local lempira currency and was installed
in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU
Consulting Group.

Juan Mayen, 28, chief executive of TGU, led the effort to bring the ATM
to Honduras in hopes of educating people about virtual assets through
first-hand experience.

Until now, there was no [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) way to buy crypto-currencies, he said.

> “You had to do it peer-to-peer, look for someone who ... was willing
to do it, meet in person and carry X amount of cash, which is very
inconvenient and dangerous given the environment in Honduras,” he said.

On Friday, one [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) was trading at $3,237, and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/); $48,140. If
the service is popular, Mayen said he hoped to install more units.

To make a purchase, users have to scan official identification and input
personal data such as a phone number.

Many software developers in Honduras are already paid in
cryptocurrencies, Mayen said, adding that it will also be a cheaper
option to send remittances.

In 2020, Hondurans living abroad - mainly the United States - sent $5.7
billion, about 20% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), in
remittances.

The Congress of El Salvador approved in June a proposal by President
Nayib Bukele to make the country the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin
as legal tender.

Elsewhere in the region, lawmakers presented draft bills in Panama that
regulate the use of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and its status as a legal tender.
