![How Bitcoiners Should Watch the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium][1]

When Jerome Powell steps up to the podium Friday at the Federal
Reserve’s annual economic symposium, held virtually this year but
traditionally near Jackson Hole, Wyo., he’s likely to deliver a speech
that has had many revisions in the past two months.

While many market participants expect the Fed chair to announce a date
and pace for tapering it’s $120 billion a month of bonds purchases, the
dominance of the Delta variant of Covid-19 makes such a pronouncement
less certain, some economists say.

> “I was expecting him to maybe announce plans for tapering but the
increase in the Delta variant makes it less likely,” said David
Beckworth, a former international economist at the U.S. Treasury
Department. “We know for certain there’s more caution but the economy is
still growing rapidly, inflation is high,” said Beckworth, now a senior
fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “I think you
can make a case for why they might still go ahead and taper.”

Some crypto analysts see tapering as an obstacle for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
speculation, since quantitative easing is generally thought to give
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s the liquidity to invest more in riskier assets. Because of
macroeconomic uncertainty created by the course of the pandemic,
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)ers may be able to continue to count on quantitative easing
staying at the same pace or tapering at a slower pace than might have
been expected a few months ago – when coronavirus-related restrictions
looked to be nearing an end, as vaccines became more widely distributed.

In last month’s Fed meeting minutes, officials at the central bank
expressed an interest in delinking quantitative easing from interest
rates, which could give the Fed more flexibility to maneuver without
causing a “taper tantrum,” wherein market expectations for the Fed funds
rate go up because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect interest rate hikes to follow, Kelly
said.
