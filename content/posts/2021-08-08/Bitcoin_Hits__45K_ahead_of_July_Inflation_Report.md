![Bitcoin hits $45K ahead of July inflation report, but one fractal
hints at looming correction][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest level in more than two months with
just a few days remaining before the July inflation report. The top
cryptocurrency climbed 1.65% to $45,363 on Aug.8, continuing the upside
momentum that has already seen it jumping 21.62% from its August 5 low
of $37,300.

[Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) was strong among the Bitcoin rivals as well. Ether (ETH), the
second-largest crypto by market cap, increased 29.78% from its Aug. 3
low of $2,630, crossing over $3,100 on Sunday. Its gains came after
Ethereum’s London hard fork went live on Aug. 5, which should add
deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH.

On Wednesday, Aug.11, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics will
release July’s inflation report, with markets forecasting a 0.5% spike.
The projections appear after the consumer price index (CPI) jumped to
5.4% year-over-year in June to log its biggest increase in 13 years.

Bitcoin bulls have responded positively to the recent inflation reports.
They effectively guarded the cryptocurrency against falling below
$30,000 after the May 19 crash. Meanwhile, their recent efforts to push
the prices above $40,000, eventually leading into a slow upside break
above $45,000, indicates strong demand for Bitcoin, which appears to be
breaking out of its summer slump.

Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital,
highlighted a Glassnode chart that showed dramatic spikes in entities
entering the Bitcoin network, matching the growth with the rising
BTC/USD rates.

Additionally, on-chain analyst Willy Woo said the ongoing Bitcoin
momentum should push its prices above $50,000, citing supply-demand
imbalance in the market. He said that all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) cohorts were buying
Bitcoin, which led to supply shock. Woo referred to a chart he posted on
July 15 when Bitcoin market was correcting lower after peaking out
sessional at $36,675. The graph, as shown below, highlighted events of
Bitcoin liquidity shock across all the exchanges and their relation to
the prices.

For instance, in 2019, Bitcoin rebounded by more than 50% after bouncing
off from its 23.6 Fib line near $7,357. But the cryptocurrency faced
extreme selling pressure near its 61.8 Fib line of $10,613. Eventually,
it resumed its downtrend and crashed to as low as $3,858 in March 2020.
If the fractal repeats, Bitcoin could face extreme resistance at 61.8
Fib level at $46,792 and correct lower to retest its 200-day EMA, which
currently sits below $20,000.
