Ethereum price saw a bullish breakout against Bitcoin on July 9 and
veteran trader Peter Brandt believes this could trigger a new altcoin
season. Popular trader Peter Brandt believes that Ether (ETH) saw a
significant breakout in its ETH-BTC pair on July 9. According to the
veteran trader, the breakout could be a signal that a new altcoin season
could occur in the near-term.

Brandt tweeted: “Significant breakout in ETH-BTC with target of .03276
BTC. Most alts should gain on Bitcoin in near future.” The strong
performance of alternative cryptocurrencies in recent weeks coincides
with an Ether rally and the expectation that upcoming network upgrades
will solve the scaling issues that plague the network during peak
transaction phases.

In the past week Cardano (ADA), Kyber Network (KNC), Compound (COMP),
and Chainlink (LINK) four major altcoins recorded substantial gains
against the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin, and Ether.

All four cryptocurrencies had key network upgrades, product launches, or
high-profile announcements which drove their values higher.

The positive sentiment around alternative cryptocurrencies combined with
exploding demand for decentralized finance-related tokens seems to have
added to the confidence of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

According to data from Binance Futures, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s remain majority long
on many altcoin pairs. In fact, more than 50% of traders on the platform
are holding long contracts on LINK, ADA, KNC, and COMP.

Some traders predict the Ether rally will continue in the third quarter
of 2020 due to a favorable market structure and currently the altcoin is
testing a significant multi-year resistance level at $250. The altcoin
briefly broke above this level three times in the past two weeks.

Ether trading volume has also remained relatively high throughout the
past ten days as the price hovers above $240. This suggests that buyers
are keen to push the price higher despite strong selling pressure at a
key resistance area.
