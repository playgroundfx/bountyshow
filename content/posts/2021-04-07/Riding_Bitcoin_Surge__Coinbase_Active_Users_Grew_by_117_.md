Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase saw a whopping 117% quarter-over-
quarter increase in monthly transacting users, the firm revealed Tuesday
in its voluntary earnings report. All those users helped Coinbase rake
in $1.8 billion over the quarter, driving a net income of approximately
$730 million to $800 million, according to a new filing that comes ahead
of the company’s Nasdaq listing next week.

Revenue Tops $1.8B][1]

All the numbers point to a business riding high as interest in
cryptocurrency tracks upward with the price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -1.84%),
ether (ETH, -1.92%) and other leading assets.

Active users on Coinbase jumped from 2.8 million in the fourth quarter
of 2020 to 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Verified users – or
the total number of people with Coinbase accounts – increased from 43
million at the end of 2020 to 56 million at the end of Q1 2021. Trading
volumes topped $335 billion in Q1. For all of 2020, trading volume was
$193 billion. Total assets on Coinbase’s platform increased from $90
billion to $223 billion, nearly a 150% increase quarter-over-quarter.
Showing how solidly Coinbase has cemented itself at the center of the
current bull run, some $122 billion of those assets were from
institutions.

On the retail side, the company will be adding more assets and giving
people more access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications,
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during Tuesday’s earnings call. On the
institutional side, the company will continue to build out its prime
brokerage offering and use its Bison Trails acquisition to create what
Armstrong called the “Amazon Web Services for crypto.”
