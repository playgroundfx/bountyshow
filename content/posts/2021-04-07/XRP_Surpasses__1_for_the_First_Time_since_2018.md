The price of XRP has surpassed $1 on Tuesday for the first time since
March 2018, putting its market valuation at around $47 billion.
Moreover, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the global market has
broken out against the Bitcoin (BTC) pair, causing it to see significant
technical momentum. When XRP was hovering at around $0.75,
cryptocurrency traders noted that XRP’s market structure was bullish.

Cantering Clark, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader, said that XRP has
all the technical components to rally. Since then, XRP has rallied from
$0.75 to over $1.

On Tuesday, Clark said: “Not for nothing, $XRP technically has taken all
necessary strides to be bullish. After the exchange delistings and
write-off by most of CT, this essentially left the market short from
both a positional and sidelined standpoint. This can move much higher.
Another well-known trader, recognized as Kaleo, noted that XRP’s
breakout against Bitcoin is particularly optimistic.

After its breakout above $1, Kaleo explained that XRP is on the verge of
breaking out of a three-year downtrend against Bitcoin.

> He noted: “$XRP / $BTC is about to break out of a 3 year downtrend.
Zero exposure here seems irresponsible. When this sh*tcoin starts to
pump, it makes vertical moves (aka all at once for a burst). Still very
early.”

Another catalyst behind XRP atop the technical momentum has been its
growing social volume. According to analysts at Santiment, a data
analytics platform, the social volume of XRP has been growing rapidly in
tandem with several other cryptocurrencies.

The analysts stated: “Most #altcoins have been maintaining their upward
trajectory to start the week, with no greater surge among top 100 assets
than what we’ve seen from $STX, which is seeing a 5-month high in social
volume. Other spikes include $XRP, $XTZ, $FTM, and $BTG.” If the
technical structure of XRP remains intact and the social volume remains
consistently high, the momentum of XRP could potentially take the
cryptocurrency to the next major resistance area. Technically, the next
resistance level is at around $1.20 with a macro sell-wall at $2, dating
back to December 2017.
