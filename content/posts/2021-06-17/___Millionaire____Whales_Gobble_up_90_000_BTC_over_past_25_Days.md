Bitcoin whales are stocking up, with “millionaire” addresses
accumulating around 90,000 Bitcoin worth $367 billion over the past 25
days. The accumulation was identified by crypto market data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/)
Santiment, which identified that wallets holding between 100 and 10,000
BTC — described by Santiment as “millionaire tier” addresses — are now
the largest segment of Bitcoin hodlers and currently account for 48.7%
of Bitcoin’s supply.

The recent buying spree places the millionaire addresses at a seven-week
high for the number of Bitcoin held, with the addresses representing
more than 9.11 million BTC — down just a couple of percent from their
mid-April high. Miners also appear to be accumulating BTC, with on-chain
analytics provider, Glassnode, identifying that weekly Bitcoin outflows
from miner addresses have slumped to a five-month low of roughly $1.7
million on June 16.

While many whales and miners appear to be hodling their coins in
expectation of higher prices, transaction monitor Whale Alert has
identified two transfers of roughly 5,000 BTC or $200 million each
destined for Coinbase since June 14, suggesting at least some large
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are looking to trade their Bitcoin.
