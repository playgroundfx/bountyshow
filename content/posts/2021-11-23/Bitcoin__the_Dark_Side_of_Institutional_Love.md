Bitcoin has suffered from the former institutional love affair with it.
On Monday, a significant sell-off in the stock and bond market prevented
the first cryptocurrency from returning to the upside. The recent sell-
off confirmed a bearish scenario for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) for now. And one should
watch closely to see if this situation becomes toxic for the entire
cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin fluctuated widely on Monday, and at some point, it managed to
recover an initially weak start. But pressure on equities in the US
trading session and the ongoing strengthening of the dollar dragged
crypto down. From intraday highs, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) lost 6.3% by the end of the
day, at one point falling to $55.6K.

The bears showed who is in control now, clearly demonstrating that
bounce attempts are stumbling into aggressive selling. In such an
environment, it should come as no surprise that the cryptocurrency Fear
and Greed Index moved into “fear” territory, losing 17 points to 33 –
its lowest level since October 1st.

Perhaps the following line of defence for the bulls could be the
$52.0-53.5K area, where the previous extremes and the 61.8% retracement
from the September-November rally are concentrated. One can only wonder
how ETHUSD continues to hold its critical $4000 level amid such
aggressive pressure on BTCUSD. The first cryptocurrency appears to be
under pressure from institutional sell-offs, of which there are
drastically less in Ether.
