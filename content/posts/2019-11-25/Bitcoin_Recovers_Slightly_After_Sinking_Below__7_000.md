Bitcoin price tumbled below $7,000 on Monday, showing a 24 percent
decline of its value over a month. One should remind, that the most
famous cryptocurrency touched $13,000 in July 2019. The Bitcoin’s
current depreciation is connected with the decision of China to tighten
control over cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin dropped by more than 10 percent in six months, extending the
decrease over the weekend due to concerns about the suppression of
cryptocurrency operations by China.

Recall, the Shanghai unit of the Central Bank of China (PBoC) announced
new rules of regulatory [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) regarding the digital asset market and a
number of related areas.

The major digital currency lost 11 percent since Friday's session close
and traded below $6,600 in Hong Kong yesterday, according to Bloomberg’s
report. Bitcoin descended below a key psychological level of $7,000 for
the first time since May 2019.

The world's largest cryptocurrency value was decreasing for eight days
in a row. A similar losing streak was recorded in 2014, according to the
Bitstamp data.
