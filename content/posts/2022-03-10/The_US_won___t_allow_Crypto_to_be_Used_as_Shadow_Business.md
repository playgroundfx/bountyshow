Bitcoin soared 8.8% on Wednesday, ending the day around $41.9K.
Apparently, the benchmark cryptocurrency experienced clear problems with
growth above $42K. On Thursday morning we see an equally strong reversal
move back to $39K. As a result, Bitcoin lost 5.6% in 24hours Ethereum –
4.8%, other leading altcoins from the top ten are declining from 1%
(Terra) to 7.2% (Avalanche).

According to CoinMarketCap, the total capitalization of the crypto
market decreased by 4.5% over the day, to $1.75 trillion. The Bitcoin
Dominance Index dropped from 43.0% to 42.7%.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index added 6 points to 28, climbing
into “fear” territory.

Bitcoin’s growth momentum was also supported by the positive dynamics of
stock indices, however, on Thursday morning, the positive pull on them
remains in contrast to the sell-off of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin jumped when a statement by Janet Yellen appeared on the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)
of the US Department of the Treasury, which does not contain strict
measures to control the field of cryptocurrencies. The statement was
posted, probably prematurely, and then quickly removed from the site.

Later on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden signed the first executive
order to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country. The document
contained only the most general provisions, such as consumer protection,
financial stability, technology development and the illegal use of
cryptocurrencies. More specific measures in the field of control over
the digital asset market will be developed by individual federal
departments.

In our opinion, the States are making it clear that they will not allow
cryptocurrencies to become a shadow business and be used to circumvent
sanctions, taxes, money laundering and similar things. Such control is
more difficult to implement than with centrally issued fiat money.
