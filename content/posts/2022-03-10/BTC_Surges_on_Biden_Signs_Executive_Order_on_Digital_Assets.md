March 9 (Reuters) - Bitcoin soared on Wednesday after President Joe
Biden signed an executive order that requires U.S. government agencies
to assess the benefits and risks of creating a central bank digital
dollar and other cryptocurrency issues.

The executive order potentially expands the adoption of virtual
currencies in the U.S. financial system.

Biden's order will require the Treasury Department, the Commerce
Department and other key agencies to prepare reports on "the future of
money" and the role cryptocurrencies will play.

> "With the recent sanctions regime in place as a result of the war in
Ukraine, it is doubly imperative that we have a regulatory framework in
place for digital assets that counters illicit finance, and prevent
risks to financial stability and national security," said Michael
Pierson, managing partner at law firm FisherBroyles.

The White House last year said it was considering wide-ranging oversight
of the cryptocurrency market - including an executive order - to deal
with the growing threat of ransomware and other cyber crime.

In midday trading, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rose 9.1% to $42,280, on track for its
largest percentage gain since Feb. 28, while smaller peer ether , the
coin linked to the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) network, added 6.3% to $2,740,
also set for its best day this month.

> "At 21Shares, we've always believed that the best way to introduce and
expose [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to crypto is through a safe and regulated approach,"
said Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer and co-founder of 21Shares,
the world's largest provider of crypto exchange traded products.

>

> "Today's action will help the U.S. establish itself as a leader in
crypto for years to come."

U.S. exchange traded funds ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s) tracking [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures that gained
regulatory approval late last year also jumped. ProShares Bitcoin
Strategy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) surged 9.8% and 10.2%,
respectively, in early trading.

advanced. Riot Blockchain soared 11.9% and Marathon Digital Holdings
surged 14.6%, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc added 9.4%.
