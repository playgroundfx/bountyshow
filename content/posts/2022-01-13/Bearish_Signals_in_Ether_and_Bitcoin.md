Pressure on US tech stocks was a major leitmotif in US trading
yesterday, dragging cryptocurrencies down. Crypto market capitalisation
adjusted 1.1% overnight to $2.05 trillion.

Bitcoin is losing 2% overnight, down to $42.8K and ether is losing about
1.5% to $3.3K. Other top coins are declining with much less amplitude,
as investment fund darlings rather than crypto enthusiasts have been hit
the hardest.

The Doge, which has become accepted as a means of payment for some
(inexpensive) Tesla goods, deserves a separate story. Some have noted
that goods for Doge are selling out even faster than for dollars. On the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the coin is adding 18% as of this morning and is trading at $0.20,
near the highs for the month.

This [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is a good illustration of crypto’s continued penetration of
corporate culture. On the other hand, Tesla won’t necessarily hold these
coins forever. That is, people will be more active in spending their
investments in DOGE.

The technical view of the ETHUSD makes you think sad because the selling
intensified earlier in the week while it tried to break the 200 SMA
again. The dip and consolidation below it suggests a break of the
bullish trend formed in May 2020, when the pair consolidated above this
line. In a worst-case scenario, it could be a road to $1300-1700, which
is about half of the current levels. It is extremely unlikely that in
this bear market cycle, the price of ether will lose 95% of its peak, as
it did in 2018, which could completely nullify the rise from 2020.

Bitcoin’s disposition is no less worrisome. A death cross is forming in
it as the 50-day dips below the 200-day. At the same time, the price is
below these averages, which reinforces the bearish signal. Attempts
earlier in the week to form a rebound are encountering stronger selling,
further indicating seller pressure.

The bearish picture in Ether and Bitcoin makes the entire cryptocurrency
sector look cautious in the near term. Individual growth stories, like
DOGE, run the risk of quickly losing strength today when the overall
backdrop turns negative.
