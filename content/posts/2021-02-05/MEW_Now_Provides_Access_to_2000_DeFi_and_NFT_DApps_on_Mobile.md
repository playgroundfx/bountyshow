Ethereum wallet and interface MyEtherWallet, or MEW, has brought
decentralized applications to its 1.3 million monthly users through a
new “DApps Browser” feature in the MEW mobile app. The collaboration
with DApp analytics site DappRadar opens the door for MEW users to
access more than 2,000 Ethereum based decentralized applications
including DeFi and NFT based protocols directly from their smartphone.

Through the DApps Browser, users can browse, search for and interact
with DeDApps like UniSwap, SushiSwap and Balancer to access financial
services such as loans, asset swaps, and staking. They can also track
their DeFi portfolios of loans and deposits. The wallet software enables
secure access, with the private key never leaving the device’s secure
encrypted storage, and never shared with the DApp.

Users can also access other decentralized wallet apps including Status
and Trust Wallet. While the three apps have been downloaded more than
six million times combined, DappRadar reports January only saw 72,000
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) active users, leaving plenty of room for growth from MEW’s large
user base.

Users can browse and search for specific DApps, and later this year it
is expected that iOS users will be able to view [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s and metrics for
2000 DApps that are normally only visible through web browsers within
the MEW app. These metrics are likely to include [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), weekly, and
monthly active users, total value locked, and trading volumes.
