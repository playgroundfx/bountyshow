Dec 6 (Reuters) - A flash weekend [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) crash that wiped out a fifth
of its value and caused $2 billion worth of positions to be liquidated
has soured [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) expectations of a massive run-up in the world's
largest cryptocurrency into the year-end.

Cryptocurrency analysts were not quite sure what triggered the heavy
selling, but pointed to the a plunge in margin borrowing, in fresh
futures positions and to activity by large holders of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as
evidence of mass liquidation.

Bitcoin fell as far as $41,967.5, levels that made it 40% cheaper than
the Nov. 10 record of $69,000. By Monday, it was back above $47,000,
with a lot of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s still nursing wounds.

> "Q4 will be a hard month, the prospect of hitting $100,000 as a lot of
people were hinting at due to various round numbers, technical analysis,
that's out of reach now," said Matt Dibb at Stackfunds, a Singapore-
based crypto fund distributor.

While the cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, Saturday's
crash was the biggest since a 31% collapse in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s price on May 19.
According to cryptocurrency analytics platform Coinglass, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s
market capitalisation has fallen to about $931 billion from $1.25
trillion on Oct. 21.

Saturday also saw diehard bulls and the dip-buying [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s make a
play.

According to another analytics platform, CryptoQuant, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s Korea
premium index, or what is often referred to as the kimchi premium, hit
7.72. That index, which measures [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s price gap between South
Korean exchanges and other exchanges and shows how strong bids in that
risk-loving population are, was negative a month back.

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the Central American country had
acquired an additional 150 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s, on top of the 100 it bought a week
earlier.

TOKENS AND BLOCKS

Other popular tokens including second-biggest cryptocurrency ether and
solana were dragged down, last trading down 3.6% and 7.6% respectively.
Both have significantly outpaced [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s gains over the past year.

The total market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency market now stands
at $2.35 trillion according to CoinGecko, down after topping $3 trillion
last month.

The slow wider adoption of digital assets has, however, not been
interrupted by [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) gyrations or broader concerns about global [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tightening. Regal cinemas, operated by Cineworld, and AMC Entertainment
last month announced partnerships with digital wallet companies for
accepting cryptocurrencies for buying tickets and popcorn.

Jack Dorsey-led payments giant Square's rebranding as "Block" also
demonstrated more companies' willingness to board the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) train.

Cryptocurrency fans and detractors alike will closely eye testimony from
the top executives of eight major cryptocurrency firms, including
Coinbase Global chief financial officer Alesia Haas and FTX Trading CEO
Sam Bankman-Fried, to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on
Dec. 8.

One particular area of focus for regulators is "stablecoins", which are
digital currencies whose values are pegged to a traditional asset such
as the dollar. Stablecoins are used to facilitate trading in other
cryptocurrencies.

Tether, the biggest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $75
billion, has come under fire recently over disclosures around its dollar
reserves, causing some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to grow wary.

> "If (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) cracks down hard on
stablecoins, then algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD will become
king," said Will Hamilton, head of trading and research at digital
asset-focused Trovio Capital Management.

Bitcoin spot trading volumes into Tether decreased for the third
consecutive month in November, according to data from CryptoCompare,
while volume in the second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin, increased 11%.
