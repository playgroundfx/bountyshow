HONG KONG (Reuters) - Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency
exchanges, said on Friday it would restrict Hong Kong users from trading
derivative products, the latest in a series of changes the exchange has
made to improve compliance standards.

Users will not be able to open new derivatives products accounts with
immediate effect, and Hong Kong users will have to close their existing
positions from a date to be announced, the statement said, adding this
was “in-line with our commitment to compliance”

Regulators in Hong Kong as well as in Britain, Germany, Japan and Italy
have been ratcheted up pressure on Binance in recent month, worried
about consumer protection and the standard of anti-money laundering
checks at crypto exchanges generally.

Last month, the exchange’s CEO, Zhao Changpeng, said he wanted to
improve relations with regulators and that Binance would seek to
establish regional headquarters, breaking with its decentralised
structure.

Binance also said last month it would wind down its futures and
derivatives business in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
