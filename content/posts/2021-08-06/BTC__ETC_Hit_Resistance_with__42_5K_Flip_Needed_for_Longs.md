![Bitcoin and Ethereum hit resistance with $42.5K flip needed for BTC
longs][1]

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are due for a “huge” move, but short-term
signals suggest a correction, an analyst warned on Friday. Data from
Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed both BTC/USD and
ETH/USD acting near critical range resistance as the week drew to a
close. A late surge the day before punctuated an overall downtrend after
swift upside throughout the previous week, but Friday reinforced the
idea that longer-term resistance would remain in place.

In his latest video update, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de
Poppe highlighted an area above $42,500 as necessary to reclaim in order
to seek long BTC positions. “I refuse to become bullish on Bitcoin at
this stage unless we are able to flip this level for support,” he said.

> “If we have a breakout like this in which we rally towards $45,000 and
flip this zone, then, of course, I’m going to look for longs, but right
now, in this structure, I’m not interested at all.” A similar story held
true for ETH/USD, also at resistance, with little evidence that the buzz
around the London hard fork would spark a definitive change in the
longer-term paradigm. Others were slightly more optimistic, with fellow
trader and analyst Rekt Capital arguing that Bitcoin was doing
“everything right” in order to ditch its previous price range in place
since May.
