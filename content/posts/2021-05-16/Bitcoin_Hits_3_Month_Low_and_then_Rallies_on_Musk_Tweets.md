Bitcoin rallied from a three-month low on Monday in a volatile session
that saw [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s initially selling and then buying cryptocurrencies in
the wake of Tesla boss Elon Musk’s tweets about the carmaker’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
holdings.

In his latest tweet, Musk said “Tesla has not sold any [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)”. That
seeming clarification came after weekend tweets hinted that Tesla was
considering or may have already sold some of its massive holdings.

Musk has boosted crypto markets with his enthusiasm for the asset class,
but has lately roiled trade by appearing to cool on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in favour of
its one-time parody, dogecoin. The gyrations are beginning to spook even
steeled traders.

Bitcoin fell more than 9% on Monday to as low as $42,185, its lowest
since Feb. 8, but rallied back to around $45,190 as of 0911 GMT.

Ether, linked to the [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) blockhain, fell to as low as $3,123.94,
and then bounced back to $3,540. Dogecoin fell nearly 7%, and all three
are well under recent records.

> “A nice pop, but this is small versus the Musk-induced selling that
has been taking place lately,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at
Markets.com. “There is nothing new I can say about [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) – volatile,
highly speculative, easy to manipulate; a bubble.”

Bitcoin, designed as a payment tool, is little used for commerce in
major economies, hampered by high volatility and relatively costly
transactions.

The most popular digital currency is now down a third from its record
high in mid-April and JPMorgan’s crunching of fund flow data shows
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exiting positions in recent weeks.

On Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would stop taking [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as payment,
owing to environmental concerns about energy use to process
transactions. Defending that decision on Sunday, he suggested Tesla may
have sold its own holdings.

> An unverified Twitter account called @CryptoWhale, said "Bitcoiners
are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla
dumped the rest of their #Bitcoin holdings. With the amount of hate
@elonmusk is getting, I wouldn't blame him..."

> In response, Musk wrote: “Indeed.”

It was not clear whether he was confirming sales or whether he referred
only to the fact that he had faced criticism, until his clarification in
Monday’s tweet.

Musk said Tesla would not sell its [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), but the cryptocurrency has
dropped by almost a quarter since Musk’s reversal on Tesla taking it as
payment.

Dogecoin has also yet to fully recover from Musk describing it as a
“hustle”, although he did boost the price last week by saying he was
working to improve its efficiency.

For an asset class that has surged this year, with dogecoin up about a
hundredfold, ether up more than fourfold and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) gaining 45%, some
are beginning to call time on the wild ride.

> “Why would I want to buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) right now - even if I’m bullish -
until the liquidation is over and you see some consolidation in price?”
said Chris Weston of brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.

>

> "I am closing the short-[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)/long-[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) trade and moving to the
sidelines," he added. "I feel the dust really needs to settle here."
