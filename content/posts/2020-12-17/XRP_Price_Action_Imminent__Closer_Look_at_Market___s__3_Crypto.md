As the second-largest altcoin by market capitalization, XRP is hardly
far from consideration during periods of significant bullish enthusiasm
in the cryptocurrency market. Despite being 85% down from its January
2018 high, recent price spikes have sparked noticeable interest in XRP
as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s consider viable diversification candidates for their crypto
portfolios.

Any discussion about XRP often includes criticisms of Ripple, a
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) payments firm that originally created the XRP token.
Furthermore, XRP critics argue that Ripple’s ownership of the majority
of the token supply, as well as its penchant for dumping “coins” on the
market, is likely to erode any significant value for XRP holders.

As a firm located in the United States, Ripple is also contending with
the lack of regulatory clarity in the country. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission is yet to state whether the XRP token is a security,
a ruling that could have significant implications for the firm.

In the absence of clear-cut [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, U.S.-based [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s appear
reluctant to risk significant exposure to XRP. Also, traders who bought
above $1 back in 2018 might be expecting considerable selling pressure
as they attempt to recoup their initial investment, likely keeping
prices lower.

With XRP being the third coin by market capitalization, perhaps the
token is primed for an institutional push as well. In its 2020
shareholder letter, financial risk management firm FRMO Corp singled out
XRP as “one of the more intriguing [crypto]currencies,” adding:

> “If the transaction velocity of XRP were to rise greatly, the number
of currency units would decline greatly, thereby creating a substantial
return even if the coin itself did not experience an increase in market
capitalization. It would, however, experience an increase in value per
unit.”

It’s perhaps important to point out that FRMO’s analysis relies on an
exponential increase in XRP utility, which would cause transaction fee
payments to rise significantly. According to the XRP tokenomics model,
transaction fees, which are in themselves small fractional units of the
token, are burned. On the contrary, this amount is paid to miners and
network validators for mined cryptocurrencies.

In theory, a rising utility for XRP would mean a major increase in the
total amount collected as fees. Since this amount is inevitably
destroyed, XRP’s circulating supply would begin to decline constantly,
thus creating a situation where token demand outstrips available coins.
This significant decline could be accelerated by the XRP community
voting for Ripple to burn all of its XRP token holdings. Earlier in
December, Ripple chief technical officer David Schwartz hinted at such a
possibility, adding that the company would be unable to stop the move.
