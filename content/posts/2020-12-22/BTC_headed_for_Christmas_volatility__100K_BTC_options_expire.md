In a Monday tweet, crypto data provider Skew reported that 102,200
Bitcoin (BTC) [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) will expire on Friday. Options contracts allow
holders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price, which is known as
the strike price. The Friday expiry has notable clusters around the
$15,000 strike price and the $20,000 strike price, according to Skew.

The expiry date of Bitcoin [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) contracts is widely regarded as a
volatile event for the flagship cryptocurrency because, as the expiry
nears, holders adjust their contracts. Traders who are in profit may
also decide to receive the payout and dump the cryptocurrency.

Such events have been known to cause large fluctuations in Bitcoinâ€™s
value. Typically, the impact of a contract on BTC price becomes more
apparent roughly one or two days before expiry. Crypto derivatives
trading has soared this year as more traders and institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
look for added Bitcoin exposure. Last week, crypto derivatives platform
Deribit began offering Bitcoin futures with a $100,000 strike price
expiring on Sept. 24, 2021. In other words, Bitcoin enthusiasts who
think the cryptocurrency will reach a six-figure moonshot can now take
that bet in the futures market.

Roughly $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin futures are set to expire on
Christmas day, setting the stage for a volatile week in the
cryptocurrency market.
