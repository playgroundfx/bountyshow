Compared to major market indexes that breached record highs despite the
Covid-19 economic fallout, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) appears “less volatile” than before.
That’s according to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at
CoinShares, which sells investments in digital currencies. “Everything
else has become more volatile,” Demirors told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia”
on Monday. “As we know, volatility is a relative measure,” she said. “In
the current environment, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is actually less volatile than it has
been in the past.”

To illustrate the point, the strategist compared the gains between
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and electric carmaker Tesla’s stock. Tesla’s shares, which were
added to the broader S&P 500 index on Monday, have soared more than 676%
so far this year. Meanwhile, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has risen about 220% year-to-date
as of midnight EST Tuesday, according to Coin Metrics. “If we look at
the astronomical rise in the equities market, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rise actually
doesn’t feel so wild,” Demirors said.

Following sharp declines early in 2020, markets across the globe have
been powered mostly by unprecedented monetary stimulus introduced by
central banks worldwide in a bid to keep the economy running. Beyond
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ shifting perceptions of volatility, Demirors added that the
industry surrounding [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has matured and evolved over the last two
years.
