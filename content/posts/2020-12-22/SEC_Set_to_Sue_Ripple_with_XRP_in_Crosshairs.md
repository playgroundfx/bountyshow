Ripple will be sued by the SEC for allegedly selling unlicensed
securities in the form of XRP tokens, according to Fortune. In a move
reminiscent of Coinbase’s recent front-running of a New York Times
expose of its alleged treatment of employees of color, Ripple CEO Brad
Garlinghouse has taken the unusual step of posting to Twitter to
seemingly legislate the issue in the court of public opinion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have both escaped SEC enforcement due to their
decentralized nature. However, XRP, the token associated with Ripple,
has long been criticized by some members of the crypto community as
highly centralized. Ripple has maintained an escrow account of around 50
billion XRP, or around half of the total supply, which the CTO David
Schwartz claims to have been ‘gifted’ by the creators of the third-
largest cryptocurrency.

Despite class-action lawsuits and acrimonious splits between the
original founders, Ripple has survived to become one of the fintech
industry’s richest companies, with a reserve — primarily held in XRP —
that could theoretically be worth almost $25 billion, even after a
dramatic 13.5% drop in the price of the cryptocurrency token following
the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of the potential lawsuit.

A source with connections to Ripple told Cointelegraph that: “There’s no
way it [XRP] is not a security.”

> Ripple posted a Wells submission document to its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) explaining
its position, claiming that “By alleging that Ripple’s distributions of
XRP are investment contracts while maintaining that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether
are not securities, the Commission is picking virtual currency winners
and losers, destroying U.S.-based, consumer-friendly innovation in the
process.”
