Bitcoin (BTC) price had been acting inside a narrow range for the last
few weeks but the momentum and trend shifted as a bullish breakout
occurred on the announcement that Square had allocated 1% of its cash
reserves to BTC. This bullish breakout even caused the price to rally
from $10,600 to $11,500, which is almost $1,000 in a few days.

support][1]

Despite this strong upside move, traders are still cautious as they are
unsure whether the bullish momentum is back or if this is just a
temporary blip. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart of Bitcoin is showing a clear upward
move toward the upper range resistance. The critical factor to watch is
whether the $12,000-$12,400 resistance zone breaks as that would imply
another impulse wave is on the horizon.

While most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were expecting further movement to the downside,
the complete opposite happened. The current movements can be compared
with the start of the previous bull cycle at the beginning of 2016.
During the start of the previous bull cycle, similar movements were
seen. Itâ€™s before the parabolic moves occur, through which the period
can be defined as boring. In 2015 and 2016, a period of six months was
defined by range-bound construction before a breakout happened. During
these constructions, previous resistances were confirmed as support,
after which a dull sideways period continued to occur.

The critical level to break for further bullish momentum is the $12,000
resistance zone. However, as the current construction is similar to the
movements in 2016, a breakout could take a while to occur. In such a
way, if the breakout above $12,000 happens, a bullish move towards
$17,000 is very much on the horizon. The area around $17,000 is the next
central pivot, and final hurdle before new all-time highs can occur.
