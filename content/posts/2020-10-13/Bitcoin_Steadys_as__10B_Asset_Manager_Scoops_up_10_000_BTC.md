Bitcoin (BTC) is winning the battle of the safe havens as another
corporate buy-in sees $115 million enter its books. Asset management
giant Stone Ridge confirmed that it made the significant purchase via
its spin-off New York Digital Investment Group or NYDIG, which now has
over $1 billion in assets under management.

> “The macro backdrop against the public health backdrop has caused a
lot of people to rethink their portfolio composition,” the company’s new
CEO, Robert Gutmann, told Forbes on Oct. 13. Michael Saylor, CEO of
MicroStrategy, which purchased $425 million of BTC in August and
September, responded: “As the trillions of dollars on the balance sheets
of banks, asset managers, insurance firms, endowments, & family offices
begin their migration to the #Bitcoin universe, they will need firms
like NYDIG to guide them. $1 billion down, more to go.”

The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) comes as a new report warns that the United States Federal
Reserve will need to print $5 trillion next year. Published on Oct. 12,
the report by economists Lawrence ‘Larry’ Summers and David Cutler
calculates the indirect cost of the Coronavirus to be $16 trillion. “The
total cost is estimated at more than $16 trillion, or approximately 90%
of the annual gross domestic product of the US. For a family of 4, the
estimated loss would be nearly $200 000,” it summarizes.

Bitcoin hit highs of $11,690 on Tuesday before returning towards $11,400
at press time, still on monthly gains of 10.5% and year-to-date returns
of 60%. As Cointelegraph reported, hopes are increasing that the short
term will bring further upside, with even $17,000 coming into play
should $12,000 be flipped to support.
