After reaching the lows for the month, the first cryptocurrency received
support from buyers, as was the case at the end of January. The growth
dynamics were relatively modest, which indicates the caution of buyers.
It is likely that these are long-term holders rather than short-term
speculators, as markets generally remain wary.

Interestingly, buying during the decline has become a key outline of the
American session. After more than a 3% fall, US stock indices not only
bounced back but also managed to show growth at the end of the day. This
stimulated [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to strengthen.

A short-term surge of bullish sentiment could end quickly if risky
assets resume their decline again. If the situation in Ukraine escalates
even more, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may fall below $30,000 as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s leave for
defensive assets.

According to The New York Times, Russia is legalizing cryptocurrency to
circumvent US sanctions. Otherwise, the country will not survive the
growing sanctions pressure from Western countries.

Bitcoin rose over the past day by 10.7% to $38,500, reducing the decline
in 7 days to 5%. Ethereum jumped 12% but is still 10% lower than it was
exactly a week ago. Other leading altcoins are moving almost in unison,
adding about 10% in most cases.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to
CoinMarketCap, increased by 9.6% per day to $1.72 trillion. The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
dominance index rose 0.3 points to 42.6%, due to a smaller strengthening
of altcoins.

The index of fear and greed of the crypto market has risen from 23 to
27, into the territory of fear.
