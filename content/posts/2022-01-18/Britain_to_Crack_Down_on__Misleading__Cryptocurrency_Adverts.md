LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Britain is to crack down on "misleading"
advertisements for cryptoassets, which often target retail consumers
with poor knowledge of the risks, the finance ministry said on Monday.

Rising prices of of cryptocurrencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether have been
accompanied by a surge in advertising for such assets, particularly in
London, prompting repeated warnings from Bank of England that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
they could lose all their money.

The finance ministry said that about 2.3 million people in Britain now
own a crypto asset, but research suggests that understanding of the
sector is declining, suggesting that some users may not fully understand
what they are buying, the ministry said.

> "Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people
new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are
not being sold products with misleading claims," Britain's finance
minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.

The finance ministry set out findings from a public consultation on
promotions for cryptocurrencies.

Advertising of cryptoassets will be brought within the scope of existing
financial promotions legislation, the ministry said.

This means that promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to
rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), holding them to the
same standards as financial promotions for stocks and insurance
products, the ministry said.

Only a business regulated by the FCA or Bank of England would be allowed
to issue their own promotions for cryptoassets, forcing unregulated
firms to pay a regulated company to approve their advertisements.

This longstanding system of approving financial promotions is itself due
to be tightened by the FCA.

Industry body CryptoUK said it welcomed any clarity and guidance on
promotions and will seek dialogue on how the measures are implemented.

'GLORIFIED PYRAMID SCHEMES'

> "What would have a far bigger impact is cracking down on social media
accounts where people claim to have made their millions from buying
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), most of which are ultimately scams or glorified pyramid
schemes," said Laura Suter, head of personal finance at investment
platform AJ Bell.

The ministry said that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the distributed
ledger technology, or [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), that underpins cryptocurreinces would
not be included in the new rules on promotions.

Secondary legislation to implement the changes will be brought forward
once parliamentary time allows.

Britain's advertising watchdog warned soccer club Arsenal in December
over advertisements for its "fan tokens", a type of cryptocurrency
embraced by soccer clubs this year as coronavirus pummelled revenue.

The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said cryptoassets are a "red-
alert priority" amid increased online advertising and promotion.

Other European regulators have moved to tighten curbs on such
advertising. Mass cryptoasset campaigns in Spain will require
authorisation from the CNMV stock market supervisor, the government said
on Monday.
