The cryptocurrency market lost 2% of its capitalisation in the past day
to $2.0trn. Buyers stepped up in the market between 8-11 January, soon
after a dip to this round level. But as we can see, the bulls’ strength
was not prolonged enough.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index added 2 points to 24. The 18th of
November was the last time we saw levels above 50. Since then, the
cryptocurrency market has been steadily in a downtrend, with the overall
crypto market capitalisation down 30%.

Bitcoin is losing 2% overnight, retreating to the $42K mark, returning
to an area of local lows before last week’s rebound. Wariness prevails
in traditional financial markets on Tuesday morning, so a fall under
$42K could quickly turn into a test of the $40K level.

The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) chart is increasingly clearly showing a downward reversal
with a continuation within the three-month down channel. The RSI index
on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts remains in neutral territory, meaning there is still
room for a decline. The 50-day moving average is deeper under the
200-day moving average, indicating that the pair is in a bearish trend.

Ether pulled back to $3180 from the region of $3500, and it is sinking
under the bears’ pressure.

The methodical selloffs are exhausting market participants, where the
feedback loop is solid: price increases spur purchases, pushing prices
up even more. Downturns or a prolonged period of sideways trading causes
disappointment and waning interest. After all, many people come to
cryptocurrencies looking for a quick buck. They are willing to take high
risks, but the lack of momentum dampens the excitement. After rapid
growth in 2020 and 2021, we should not be surprised to see the market
cool down.

The long-term weekly candlestick chart of Bitcoin shows that over the
past seven years, support turns the market around, even during a
depression, it passes through the 200-week moving average. This line is
now near 19k, and by the end of the year, it will be slightly above 20K.

A bear market development for cryptocurrencies could push Bitcoin back
to 20 before the end of 2022 in a pessimistic scenario. These levels
could be the best prices to buy, although experience suggests it could
take another year of sluggish growth before seeing a new powerful
uptrend and FOMO.
