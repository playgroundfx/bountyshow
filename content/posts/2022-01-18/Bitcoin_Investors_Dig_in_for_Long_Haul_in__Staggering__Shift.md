As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) heads into 2022, a growing cohort of long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s is
doubling down on its stashes of the cryptocurrency, hoping a December
dip was merely a festive blip.

Some industry watchers point to the underlying stability of such long-
term investments as potentially promising indicators for the capricious
cryptocurrency.

Since last July, for example, the amount of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) held in digital
wallets with no outflows for more than five months has been steadily
increasing, according to digital currency brokerage Genesis Trading.

In addition, the amount of the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) held in "illiquid" wallets -
which spend less than quarter of their inflows - is also rising, meaning
fewer coin are being actively traded, it added, citing wallet data
across several exchanges.

> "The number of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s that haven't moved in over a year has been
climbing since July," said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at
Genesis Trading. "That's pretty staggering."

Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were nonetheless sent diving for cover in December when
the world's most popular cryptocurrency sunk almost 20%, roughly the
same as the second-biggest coin ether, with risk appetite hit by
inflation fears and a quicker pace of interest rate hikes from the U.S.
Federal Reserve.

While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether both posted gains last week - up 2.9% to $43,107
and up 6.3% to $3,350, respectively - they are still some way off their
2021 highs of $69,000 and $4,868

'STRONG HANDS'

Many cryptocurrency experts caution that no one has been known to
reliably predict [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)'s characteristically wild price swings. In
2017, for example, it went from about $1,000 to around $20,000. In early
2020, it sunk below $4,000 at one point before beginning a dizzying
rise.

Yet advocates of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other coins say the increasing acceptance
of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance and investing in recent years
has shored up the sector.

Cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital said their research showed a
similar shift towards [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) being held for longer period by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
which it said "illustrates a transference from shorter-term 'weak hands'
to long-term 'strong hands'."

Crypto data platform Coinglass's [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) Fear & Greed index, has wavered
between 10 and 29 since the start of the year, which could be an
indicator of a possible market bottom and buying opportunities,
according to Will Hamilton, head of trading & research at Trovio Capital
Management.

> "Previous market bottoms in July 2021 and March 2020 correlated with
Fear and Greed scores of 19 and 10 respectively," he added.

For the uninitiated, 0 indicates "extreme fear" and 100 is "extreme
greed"

MUSK AND DOGE

There were, meanwhile, more headlines for cryptocurrencies last week.

Meme-based dogecoin stole the spotlight after TeslaÂ CEO Elon Musk
tweeted that the company would accept it as payment for select
merchandise.

The tweet sent dogecoin up nearly 12%.

> "If more people are looking to buy Tesla merchandise with dogecoin
then there's more demand," Acheson said, adding that this move could
improve fundamental factors for dogecoin.

Cryptocurrency Solana was another altcoin in focus, with Bank of America
analysts saying the Solana [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) could pull market share away from
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) and "could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem".

Elsewhere, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miners bounced back from mining crackdowns in China
and the recent unrest in Kazakhstan, one of the world's primary centres
for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining.

Bitcoin's mean "hash rate" a measure of the power of the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
computing network, touched an all time high of over 215 million
terahashes per second on Thursday, according to [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data provider
Glassnode.
