There is information that the U.S. tax authorities may put pressure on
the owners of cryptocurrency. This information for the time being  will
affect only possible violations of tax laws, but too much smoke not to
be fire. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has started sending letters
to potential holders of cryptocurrency about their violation of federal
tax laws.

The actions are planned to be completed before the beginning of autumn,
and the information comes from the head of IRS, Charles Rettig, who
added: “Taxpayers should take these letters seriously. IRS is expanding
its activities, including сryptocurrency as well"

While there is no information about how these letters will turn for
cryptocurrency holders, it is noted only that we can talk about fines.

It is worth recalling that quite recently, namely at the beginning of
this month, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke negatively about virtual
money, in such a context that they are unreliable and can contribute to
the prosperity of criminal activity.
