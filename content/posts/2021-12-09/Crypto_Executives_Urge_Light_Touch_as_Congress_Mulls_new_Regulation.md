WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Top executives from six major
cryptocurrency companies including Coinbase and Circle on Wednesday
urged Congress to provide clearer rules for the booming $3 trillion
industry, but warned that overly tough restrictions would push it
overseas.

The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee hearing
marked the first time the industry's senior leaders have explained their
businesses to U.S. lawmakers amid growing concerns cryptocurrencies may
pose systemic risks and hurt [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Crypto executives repeated calls for careful, bespoke rules rather than
forcing the industry to comply with existing [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

> "Without tailored legislative solutions that are openly debated with
public participation, the United States risks unnecessarily onerous and
chilling laws and [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s," warned Alesia Haas, chief executive of
Coinbase Inc.

Congress is unlikely to make new crypto rules anytime soon, according to
analysts, and lawmakers treated the hearing primarily as a fact-finding
exercise.

Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the panel, said
there are questions about proper oversight and singled out Facebook
Inc's stablecoin plans as a major concern given the company's huge
global reach.

Some lawmakers, in particular Republicans, praised the executives for
leading the way on what could be a pivotal technology.

> "I am tremendously impressed. I see a lot of ingenuity, a lot of
entrepreneurial spirit," said Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas
Republican. "We need to be supportive of you."

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Paxos CEO
Chad Cascarilla, Stellar Development Foundation CEO Dennelle Dixon and
BitFury head Brian Brooks also testified.

DIGITAL ASSETS

The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and in particular stablecoins --
digital assets pegged to traditional currencies -- has caught the
attention of regulators, who fear they could put the financial system at
risk if not properly monitored.

Some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Securities and
Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, are also concerned the products
could be used for illicit purposes, or to take advantage of unsuspecting
consumers.

In November, a U.S. Treasury-led working group recommended Congress pass
a law specifying stablecoins should only be issued by companies that
have insured deposits, like banks.

Executives said they would welcome regulatory clarity, which could help
the industry expand, but that overly restrictive rules could prove
counterproductive.

The rapid growth in the sector underscores there is strong [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
appetite for digital assets and should be supported with clear rules
rather than stifled, they said.

BitFury's Brooks, who was formerly CEO of Binance's U.S. business and
before that a bank regulator, told lawmakers cryptocurrencies are
similar to traditional assets.

> "We are the last country standing that hasn't figured that out," he
said.

But the complexity and volatility of cryptocurrencies, as well as wildly
varying standards around disclosure, reserves, consumer protection and
other policies left some lawmakers concerned.

> "Most of the people that I know that have invested in cryptocurrencies
(have done so)...because they think they can get rich quick," said
Representative Juan Vargas. "We've seen this before, unfortunately, and
it led to the financial crisis."
