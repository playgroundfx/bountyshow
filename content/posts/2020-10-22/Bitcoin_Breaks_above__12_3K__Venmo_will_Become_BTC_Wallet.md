Bitcoin (BTC) gained almost 5% on Oct. 21 as bullish price action
combined with fresh corporate adoption [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) to boost gains. Data from
Cointelegraph Markets and Coin360 showed a strong 24 hours for bulls on
Wednesday, with BTC/USD topping out at $12,400.

At press time, $12,300 formed the focal point, around an hour after
Reuters reported that payment giant PayPal plans to support Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies via its wallet and Venmo app from 2021. The
announcement added to an already buoyant BTC trading environment, with
$12,000 resistance evaporating overnight on Tuesday.

Weekly gains stand at 8.5% for Bitcoin, which is increasingly diverging
from other macro assets, which put in lackluster performance over the
same period. Earlier, Cointelegraph published a list of factors which
one analyst believes all support the bull case for Bitcoin going
forward. PayPal should also support altcoins Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC)
and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Following the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), ETH/USD increased by a
modest 2.2% to $378, while BCH/USD put in 4.5% gains to hit $456.
