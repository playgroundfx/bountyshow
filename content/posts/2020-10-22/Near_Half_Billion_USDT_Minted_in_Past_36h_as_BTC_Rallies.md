The Tether (USDT) Treasury has minted almost half a billion new USDT
tokens and distributed more than 185 million tokens to exchanges and
other addresses in the last 36 hours. As shown by [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) tracker
Whale Alert, two transactions of 150 million and 300 million USDT tokens
were minted on Oct 20 and Oct 21 respectively. The first 150 million was
printed only hours before Paypal’s announcement and the Bitcoin (BTC)
price rally that followed.

Although some raised the usual allegations of market manipulation in
response to Whale Alert’s tweets, both transactions were acknowledged by
Tether CTO Paolo Adoino as unissued “inventory replenishes” on the Tron
(TRX) Network: Since yesterday’s 150 million USDT minting, 15
transactions totaling 185.9 million USDT have been sent to exchanges
including Bitfinex, and Huobi, as well as several “unknown addresses.”
Almost 70% (126.9 million USDT) of the tokens sent out of the Treasury
ended up going to Binance.

Tether issuance has been frequently linked with Bitcoin price rallies,
although there is a constant “chicken and egg” debate over whether the
issuance leads the rally, or is in response to demand. In April this
year, Tether minted 160 million USDT during Bitcoin’s price rally to
$9,000. It came one week after research was released that argued that
USDT isn’t used to manipulate Bitcoin’s price. Tether’s market cap has
grown by more than 400% year-to-date to reach $15.9 billion.
