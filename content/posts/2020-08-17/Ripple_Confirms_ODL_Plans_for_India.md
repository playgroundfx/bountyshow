Ripple‘s Managing Director for South Asia and MENA, Navin Gupta, has
revealed more details about the company’s plans for India. In an
interview with local Indian media, Gupta confirmed that Ripple plans to
create a corridor for India.

With a 3-year presence in India, Ripple began operations in Bangalore
and Mumbai, according to Gupta. Since then, the company has managed to
grow and offers its services to 5 major banking institutions: Kotak
Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank and the Federal Bank.

Details about Ripple’s corridor for India  
Despite the growth in India, Ripple has not yet implemented its payment
solution with the digital asset XRP, On-Demand Liquidity. In this
regard, Gupta described the country as a fast growing market, and with a
population of 35 million Indians living outside the country, as an
attractive location for implementing Ripple’s cross-border payment
solution.

Data from CoinGecko shows that the trading volume on the major crypto
exchanges in India has been steadily increasing in 2020. The lifting of
the ban on crypto trading by the Indian Supreme Court in early March has
had a visible impact.

On the exchange WazirX, the trading volume has reached an annual high of
$12 million. Furthermore, the trading volume for Zebpay peaked on August
2 with $8 million in total, demonstrating the growing adoption of
cryptocurrencies in India and the market’s potential for solutions like
those offered by Ripple.

The Ripple executive said that of the total remittances sent to India
from abroad, 7% of the total value is lost due to fees. In this regard,
Gupta stated the following:

Ripple is keen to introduce the ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) solution to
the India market to make remittances faster, easier, better and cheaper
through the use of digital assets.

However, Ripple has one major concern and that is the lack of clear
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and a robust legal framework to support operations with
digital assets and cryptocurrencies. However, Gupta also said the
company is optimistic about India’s progress in this area.

As reported by CNF, Ripple has proposed to the Government of India a
model legal framework. Presented in late June 2020, the framework
proposes policies that will enable the country to benefit from
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology and crypto trade. However, there has been no
affirmative response from the government.
