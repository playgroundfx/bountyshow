![3 reasons why traders think Bitcoin price bottomed at $29,500][1]

Traders are showing a renewed sense of hope after Bitcoin (BTC) price
held onto the $32,000 range for what could be the second day in a row.

CME futures see a bullish surge  
According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, an aggressive reversal
was observed in the CME futures basis on July 21, and this is a bullish
sign for BTC traders who scooped up ‘cheap’ futures contracts. The
resulting contango is interpreted as bullish because the futures price
is above the spot price of the asset.

Multiple zones of resistance remain in Bitcoin’s path  
Bitcoin’s recovery above $32,000 reignited the bullish optimism for many
traders but the road ahead is by no means a walk in the park due to the
multiple zones of resistance that lay overhead. According to
pseudonymous crypto Twitter analyst Rekt Capital, many of the previous
support levels for Bitcoin, including $35,000 and $37,000, could soon
act as resistance.

Exchange inflows [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly spike near market bottoms  
Another sign of bullishness came from pseudonymous Twitter user
IzzyEibani, who highlighted the recent spike in exchange inflows as a
possible sign that the bottom is in. A closer look at the chart shows
that there have been three instances in the past on Aug. 1, 2017, Nov.
30, 2018 and March 12, 2020, where inflows to exchanges spiked in a
manner similar to what was seen on July 16. Each time the market
bottomed within a short time period following the inflows.
