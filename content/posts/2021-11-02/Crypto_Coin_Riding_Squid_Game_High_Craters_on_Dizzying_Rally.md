(Reuters) - A cryptocurrency named after the wildly popular Netflix
drama “Squid Game” crashed to almost zero value on Tuesday after a
dizzying rally pushed it to almost $2,800 last week.

The so-called squid token’s market value jumped to $2.4 billion at the
peak of Monday’s trading with a trading volume of $14 million over the
last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

The reason for squid’s slump was unclear. However, several reports
including one by Gizmodo said holders of the coin were not allowed to
sell the digital coin. Reuters could not independently verify the
information.

Specialist crypto [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) outlet Coindesk reported that a digital address
dumped squid tokens and cashed out millions of dollars worth of tokens
in what it termed a “rug pull”- a situation where crypto developers
abandon a project and run away with [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ money.

Squid’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) appeared to be offline on Tuesday, while its Twitter
account was “temporarily restricted” due to unusual activity.

Squid has only traded for a week, according to CoinMarketCap.

> “Like many internet scams, [cryptocurrency scams](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-scams/) align themselves
closely to popular trends and after the hype of Squid Game, this is no
different,” said Jake Moore, cybersecurity specialist at cybersecurity
firm ESET.

Cryptocurrencies based on memes or linked to internet culture have
recorded rapid booms and busts this year, echoing soaring popularity of
mainstream cryptocurrencies such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

Last week, for instance, shiba inu cryptocurrency - a meme-inspired
cryptocurrency and a spinoff of dogecoin - muscled into the top-10
largest digital tokens by market capitalization. It has, however, barely
any practical use.

South Korean series Squid Game, which became a global sensation and the
No.1 program on Netflix, shows hundreds of cash-strapped players
competing in hyperviolent games.

Squid is traded on exchanges PancakeSwap and DODO.

Pancakeswap did not respond to a request for comment.
