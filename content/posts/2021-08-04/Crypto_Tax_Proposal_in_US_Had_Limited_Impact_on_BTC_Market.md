![Crypto Tax Proposal in US Has Had Limited Impact on Bitcoin Market][1]

On the face of it, a U.S. bill proposing to raise $28 billion through
extra cryptocurrency taxes might unnerve some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. But so
far, the market reaction to the bill has been remarkably muted. Last
Wednesday, lawmakers drafting a bipartisan infrastructure bill in
Congress proposed to raise $28 billion in extra crypto taxes by applying
new information-reporting requirements to exchanges and other providers
of crypto services.

According to a draft of the bill, any broker who transfers any digital
assets will need to file a return under a modified information reporting
regime. That would enable the Internal Revenue Service to collect taxes
already owed on capital gains from sales of digital assets. Given how
digital-asset markets often react fairly quickly to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) announcements –
the recent rumor that Amazon would accept [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as a form of payment
being one example – the bill’s plan for the extra crypto taxes has so
far had little impact on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices.

Some crypto experts said the bill might have a positive impact on the
market, because it could give digital-asset markets more traction and
visibility. Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader, views
the bill as a positive sign of adoption for the market.
