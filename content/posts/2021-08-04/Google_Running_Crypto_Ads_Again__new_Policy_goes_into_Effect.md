![Google running crypto ads again as new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) goes into effect][1]

Google is running crypto ads again after its updated financial products
and services [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) went into full effect on August 3. The multinational
giant banned crypto and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) related
advertisements back in June 2018, and the updated [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) allows
regulated crypto entities to market their services once again. ICOs have
been left out in the cold, however.

Google’s crypto ad [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) revision was first outlined in June and
stipulates that “advertisers offering [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s and
wallets” targeting U.S. consumers are allowed to advertise their
services and products if they meet specific requirements.

The move will provide additional sales for Google’s parent company
Alphabet, although crypto ads will likely be just a drop in the ocean of
the company’s $147 billion in advertisin revenue. Google’s strict
requirements are designed to weed out shady advertising and blatant
crypto scams. Advertisers must be registered with the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a “money services business and with at
least one state as a money transmitter, or a federal or state-chartered
bank entity.”

The firm will not allow ads for ICOs, DeFi trading protocols or the
promotion of purchasing, selling or trading cryptocurrencies. Celebrity
crypto endorsements are also banned, which may help in part with issues
surrounding fake celebrity endorsements.

Redditors in the r/Bitcoin subreddit saw the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that Bitcoin can once
again be promoted via Google as a “bullish” sign for the cryptocurrency,
although user “Brief-Music-5825” asserted that Google should “ban fake
crypto [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) as well. The amount of fake [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) creating FUD is
unbelievable.”
