The rise of DeFi protocols and the demand for tokens in liquidity pools
may be contributing to a huge surge in the supply of stablecoins.
According to an Sept. 3 tweet from Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter,
the current supply of stablecoins Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), HUSD,
Paxos Standard Token (PAX), USD Coin (USDC), U[SDK](https://www.fintechee.com/sdk-trading/), Tether (USDT),
USDT_ETH, and USDT_TRX has been increasing by roughly $100 million [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
for almost two months.

> “Everyone got so excited about DeFi no one pointed out that
stablecoins have been adding $100m/day since mid-July,” said Carter.
“DeFi yields/interest rates are clearly a vacuum sucking in a lot of
stablecoins.” Stablecoins are popular among the tokens used in liquidity
pools for DeFi protocols which have been popping up in ever greater
numbers this year, offering larger and larger yields in the competition
to attract locked funds. DAI and USDC are also the most lent and
borrowed stablecoins in the Compound protocol and are also the most
borrowed stablecoins in Aave.

However, Tether still holds 80% dominance over the stablecoin market.
According to data from CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of
Tether increased from $9.2 billion on July 15 to more than $13.7 billion
as of today, a jump of almost 50%. USDT’s trading volume has surged
roughly 150% in the same time period, from $21.9 billion to more than
$54 billion as of this writing.
