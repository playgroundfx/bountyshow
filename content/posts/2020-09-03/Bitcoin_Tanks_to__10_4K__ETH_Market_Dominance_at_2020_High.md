BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for
market technicians. Bitcoin continues its downward trend Thursday, with
prices descending as low as $10,468 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.
While it has recovered a bit, traders selling for profits has certainly
been the theme right now.

> “This is similar to what we’ve seen as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) approached the $10,000
and $11,000 levels, where profit-taking occurred on a few different
occasions,” said John Kramer, a trader at crypto over-the-counter firm
GSR. “Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will see this as an opportunity to buy the dip.”

Just like Wednesday, leveraged liquidations played a role in
exacerbating [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price drop. However, Thursday’s wipeout of long
traders on derivatives exchange BitMEX was a bit higher, with $10
million in hourly liquidations topping Wednesday’s $9 million hourly
spree, the equivalent of a margin call in crypto parlance.

> “Some people who were buying in over $11,500 in BTC with leverage
suddenly got stopped out when we moved back down towards $11,100,” said
Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank.

Thomas suspects [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price will not reach new 2020 highs in the
near term, despite testing that level as recently as Tuesday when the
price hit $12,085. “I think we trade in the $11,000-$12,000 range for a
while,” he said.

Ether dominance dominates  
The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH),
was down Thursday, trading around $402 and slipping 7.6% in 24 hours as
of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). But while the price is down, ether’s
dominance of the broader crypto market hit a 2020 high of over 14%
Wednesday. Although dipping a bit Thursday, the last time ether’s share
was at these levels was back in August 2018.

> “A large number of useful projects on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
contribute to ether dominance growth,” said Azamat Malaev, co-founder of
HodlTree, a decentralized lending protocol. However, scaling is an issue
that could cause ether’s share to wane, Malaev added. “To maintain this
trend, Ethereum urgently need to scale the network. For ordinary users,
transactions are already very expensive”
