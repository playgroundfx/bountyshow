* _Gulf Energy expects to form JV with Binance in Q2_
  * _Expects JV to take six months to obtain digital asset license_
  * _Plans 20MW-40MW data centres with Singtel and AIS_

BANGKOK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Thai power producer Gulf Energy Development
Pcl expects to finalise a joint venture (JV) with the world's biggest
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/), Binance, in the second quarter this year, a
senior executive told Reuters in an interview.

> "Once we conclude talks with Binance on business model and shareholder
agreements, a JV will be formed, which will apply for the license with
regulators," Gulf chief financial officer Yupapin Wangviwat said.

She expects the JV to take about six months to obtain the license for
trading and then other features would follow.

Cryptocurrency trading has exploded in Southeast Asia’s second-largest
economy with transactions reaching 251 billion baht ($7.57 billion) in
November, prompting authorities to introduce [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

The Gulf-Binance crypto exchange would have to comply with [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s,
said Yupapin.

Last year Thailand's securities watchdog filed a criminal complaint
against Binance for operating without a digital asset license.

The move into crypto comes from its owner and CEO Sarath Ratanavadi's
plans to expand into digital infrastructure, which took shape last year
when it increased its ownership of InTouch Holdings Pcl to 42% in a 48
billion baht deal.

InTouch owns the country's the country’s largest mobile operator, AIS.

On Thursday, Gulf established a separate JV with Singapore
Telecommunications and AIS to build data centres.

Initial plans include 20 to 40-megawatts (MW) of data centres in
Thailand, Yupapin said, with an estimated cost of up to $400 million.

> "In the longer term we plan to reach 100 MW," Yupapin said on growing
demand.

BILLIONAIRE OWNER

Gulf Energy traces its beginnings to 1990s and began making its mark
after winning multiple power agreements including contracts worth
5.3-gigwatts in 2013.

It went on to have one of Thailand's biggest IPOs in 2017, catapulting
Sarath onto the Forbes Rich list, which currently ranks him as fifth
richest in Thailand with a net worth of $12.4 billion.

Gulf also expanded its infrastructure portfolio in recent years,
snapping up projects including a $1.3 billion LNG project and $927
million container terminal with the government in recent years.
