Most cryptocurrencies were under pressure from declines in US tech
stocks on Thursday.

A weak report from Meta (Facebook) was published the day before. The
company’s shares lost more than 26% on the day, with the high-tech
Nasdaq down almost 4%. The correlation between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the Nasdaq
stock index has recently reached a new high.

The day before, the first cryptocurrency was hit by a shutdown of mining
farms in Texas, caused by bad weather and a snowstorm. The state leads
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining in the US, accounting for about half of all BTC hash
rates.

Bitcoin volatility has fallen to 15-month lows in recent days. With the
comparative performance of traditional financial markets, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has
managed to add around 2.9% since the start of the day on Friday,
reaching 38,000 and again testing the upper limit of the downward
channel. However, the first cryptocurrency will need to break the key
$40,000 level to confirm bullish sentiment. Otherwise, the pressure on
BTC will continue and may even intensify.

The developers of the 14th cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu, have partnered
with fast-food restaurant Wellu’s of Naples, Italy. The restaurant will
use SHIB as a means of payment and has also fully rebranded its outlet
in token style.
