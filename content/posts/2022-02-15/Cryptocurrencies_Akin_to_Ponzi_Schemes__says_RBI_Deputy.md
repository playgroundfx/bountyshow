MUMBAI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies are akin to Ponzi schemes or
worse and banning them is the most sensible option for India to avoid
the threat they pose to financial and macroeconomic stability, a deputy
governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday.

Monday's comments from T. Rabi Sankar followed a similarly withering
assessment of digital currencies by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das only
days after the Indian government established a taxation framework for
cryptocurrencies.

> "We have also seen that cryptocurrencies are not amenable to
definition as a currency, asset or commodity; they have no underlying
cash flows, they have no intrinsic value; that they are akin to Ponzi
schemes, and may be even be worse," Sankar said in a speech.

Crypto exchanges and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been arguing for [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of
cryptocurrencies as an asset and the government's recent budget
annoucement to tax gains from these has raised hopes that the they will
not be banned.

Sankar, however, dismissed the suggestion that these highly volatile
virtual coins should be regulated and instead called for an outright
ban.

> "Cryptocurrencies are not currencies, or financial assets or real
assets or even digital assets. Therefore, it cannot be regulated by any
financial sector regulator. It is not possible to regulate something
that one cannot define," he said.

>

> "All these factors lead to the conclusion that banning cryptocurrency
is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India."

'ANONYMOUS'

Sankar said that cryptocurrencies have been developed to bypass the
regulated financial system and that he does not accept the argument that
cryptocurrencies must be permitted for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology to thrive.

> "The fact that they are anonymous, decentralised systems that operate
purely virtually makes cryptocurrencies particularly attractive to
illegal, illegitimate transactions," he said, adding that [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technology can still be promoted even if private cryptocurrencies are
banned.

>

> "It should be possible to maintain a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) without any native
cryptocurrency if transactions are authenticated centrally," Sankar
said.

Illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies totalled $14 billion
last year, Shankar said, citing a Wall Street Journal report based on a
report by [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) data platform Chainalysis Inc.

There are about 15 million to 20 million cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in
India, with total holdings of about 400 billion Indian rupees ($5.3
billion), according to industry estimates.

The RBI says the average holding continues to be small at only 1,566
rupees, which means that "wealth loss, if it is a possibility, is likely
to affect only a small fraction of these [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s".
