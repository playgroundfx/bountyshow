The first cryptocurrency returned to growth on Tuesday morning, adding
3.3% and rising to 43,500. Technically, BTCUSD held above the 50-day
moving average and received support from buyers after another touch of
this level. At the same time, however, this average is directed
downwards, emphasizing the general downward trend.

Cryptocurrencies seem to be once again trying on the role of a safe-
haven asset, becoming a little more like gold and a little less like
stocks.

Although US stock indices were under pressure on Monday, they decided to
stop the sharp decline at the end of last week. However, the high-tech
Nasdaq ended the day unchanged. European stock indicators showed a
noticeable drop under the influence of tensions around Ukraine. On the
same background, gold shot up 3% to highs since June last year. It
should be understood that in the event of a massive sale of shares, only
short-term government bonds will be the protective asset of last resort.

Institutions invested $75 million in crypto funds last week, according
to CoinShares. Over the past four weeks, net inflows to crypto funds
amounted to $209 million.  
The head of Uber said that the company would definitely start accepting
cryptocurrencies in the future. A British crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) has announced

thousands of supporters from around the world to join soon.

The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation proposed to limit the
investments of unqualified Russian [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in cryptocurrencies to 50
thousand rubles. The agency estimates tax revenues to the budget from
the legalization of the cryptocurrency market at 10-15 billion rubles,
and the main amount of payments will fall on the miners.

Overall, Bitcoin was down 0.2% on Monday, ending the day at around
$42,200. Ethereum added 0.1%, while other leading altcoins from the top
ten showed mixed dynamics: from a decrease of 1.6% (XRP) to a rise of 2
.2% (Terra).

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to CoinGecko,
grew by 0.5% per day, to $1.97 trillion. The BTC dominance index did not
change during the day, remaining at the level of 40.7%. The Fear and
Greed Index is up 2 points to 46 and is in a state of fear.
