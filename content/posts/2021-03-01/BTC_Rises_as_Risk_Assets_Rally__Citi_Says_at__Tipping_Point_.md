Bitcoin rose nearly 6% on Monday as risk assets rallied after last
week’s bond rout cooled, and Citi said the most popular cryptocurrency
was at a “tipping point” and could become the preferred currency for
international trade.

With the recent embrace of the likes of Tesla Inc and Mastercard Inc,
Bitcoin could be at the start of a “massive transformation” into the
mainstream, Citi added.

Bitcoin, which has risen to $47,000 from $4,700 last March, could in the
future become the preferred currency for international trade or face a
“speculative implosion,” the investment bank said.

It was up 5.7% at $47,834 as of 1127 GMT on the Bitstamp exchange.
Smaller rival ether rallied 7.5% to $1,525.

Bitcoin’s recent performance has come with the growing involvement of
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in recent years, contrasting with its heavy
retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) focus for most of the past decade, Citi added.

If businesses and individuals gain access via digital wallets to planned
central bank digital cash and so-called stablecoins, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s global
reach, traceability and potential for quick payments would see it
“optimally positioned” to become the preferred currency for
international trade, Citi said.

Bitcoin, designed as a payment tool, is little used for commerce in
major economies, hampered by high volatility and relatively costly
transactions. Still, it has over the past year gained traction in some
emerging markets such as Nigeria.

Such a dramatic transformation for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to the de facto currency of
world trade - a status currently held by the dollar - would depend on
changes to its market to allow wider institutional participation and
closer oversight by financial regulators, Citi said.

Still, shifts in the macro-economic environment may also make the demand
for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) less pressing, it added.

The recent surge in interest in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), sparked by a narrative that it
can act as a hedge against inflation, has driven the cryptocurrency to a
record high of $58,354 and a $1 trillion market capitalisation.

But it has pulled back more than $11,000 from those levels in the last
week on questions over the sustainability of such high prices.

> “There are a host of risks and obstacles that stand in the way of
Bitcoin progress,” Citi’s analysts wrote. “But weighing these potential
hurdles against the opportunities leads to the conclusion that Bitcoin
is at a tipping point.”
