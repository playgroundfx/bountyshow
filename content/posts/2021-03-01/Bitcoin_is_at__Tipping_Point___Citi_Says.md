LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Bitcoin is at a “tipping point” and could
either become the preferred currency for international trade or face a
“speculative implosion,” Citi analysts said.

With the recent embrace by the likes of Tesla Inc and Mastercard Inc,
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) could be at the start of a massive transformation in going
mainstream, Citi said in a report.

The growing involvement from institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in recent years
contrasts with heavy retail-focus for most of the past decade, it added.

If businesses and individuals gain access via digital wallets to planned
central bank digital cash and so-called stablecoins, the popular digital
currency’s global reach, traceability and potential for quick payments
could see its use for commerce widen dramatically, Citi said.

The surge in interest drove [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to a record high of $58,354 and a $1
trillion market capitalisation. It, however, pulled back more than
$11,000 from those levels in the last week on questions over the
sustainability of such high prices.

> “There are a host of risks and obstacles that stand in the way of
Bitcoin progress,” Citi’s analysts wrote. “But weighing these potential
hurdles against the opportunities leads to the conclusion that Bitcoin
is at a tipping point.”

Bitcoin was trading 3.9% higher at $46,980 on Monday, up nearly 63% so
far this year.
