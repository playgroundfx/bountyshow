China’s Inner Mongolia has banned cryptocurrency mining and declared its
intention of shutting all such projects by April, spurring fears the
world’s No. 2 economy will take more steps this year to eradicate the
power-hungry practice. The autonomous region, a favorite among the
industry because of its cheap power, also banned new digital coin
projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia
Development and Reform Commission’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) Feb. 25. The aim is to
constrain growth in energy consumption to about 1.9% in 2021.

The announcement unnerved an industry that’s already been through a
years-long Chinese campaign to shrink it down amid concerns over
speculative bubbles, [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) and energy waste. The draft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) was
released weeks after the National Development and Reform Commission —
China’s top economic planner — blasted Inner Mongolia for being the only
province to fail to control energy consumption in 2019.

The region now aims to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product
by 3% this year and control incremental growth of energy consumption at
about 5 million tons of standard coal, according to the draft plan.
Chinese officials first outlined proposals in 2018 to discourage crypto-
mining — the computing process that makes transactions with virtual
currencies possible but consumes vast amounts of power.
