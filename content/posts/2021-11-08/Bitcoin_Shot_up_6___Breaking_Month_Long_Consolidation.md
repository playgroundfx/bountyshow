Bitcoin moved out of an almost month-long sideways corridor, shooting up
6% in the last 24 hours. As recently as late last week, it needed
support on the downside towards $60K, but it received steady demand over
the weekend. Going above $63.5K triggered a wave of optimism, quickly
sending the price of the first cryptocurrency to highs near $66K.

The cryptocurrency fear and greed index has not yet kept pace, stopping
at 75, and has been hovering in the greed area since the middle of last
month. Crypto market capitalisation, both with and without [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), is
updating all-time highs, indicating that the whole [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) spike may be
a secondary effect in the current altcoin season.

Bitcoin has ample room to rise on the technical analysis side, as the
bulls have built-up strength during the first cryptocurrency’s month-
long consolidation. The RSI index has entered neutral territory after
being overbought from October’s rally in recent days.

After a prolonged consolidation, the jump in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price paves the way
to $83K, corresponding to 161.8% of the late September to mid-October
rally. Investors in the crypto market should be prepared that this part
of the rise could materialise rather quickly.

History suggests that entering the territory of new highs for Bitcoin
attracts extensive attention and money, amplifying the rally in the
early days until headlines about another historic high for the first
cryptocurrency and the overall capitalisation of the crypto market
become commonplace.

For seasoned cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, however, altcoin’s surge and
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s lag, as well as the timing of this event, raise unpleasant
analogies with the end of 2017. Back then, the altcoin rally was
particularly fierce from November to January. Many of the altcoins then
and now are still a long way from those highs.
