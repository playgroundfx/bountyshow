Apple should invest a portion of its massive cash reserves in Bitcoin,
Toroso Investments’ portfolio manager Dan Weiskopf posted earlier today
on the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) Think Tank [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). The site’s lead [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) strategist’s call
follows in the footsteps of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and former
Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager Raoul Pal, who both predicted Apple
would make a large scale investment in Bitcoin in the upcoming years.

Saylor retweeted and endorsed Weiskopf’s piece with the comment that the
tech giant could see a $100 billion gain in market cap by integrating
Bitcoin with their products and adding it to their holdings. With a
market cap north of $2 trillion, Apple (AAPL) is the world’s most
valuable company and has nearly $192 billion cash on hand, according to
an earnings report released on Oct. 29.

Weiskopf laid out the case that an investment in Bitcoin of between $10
billion to $20 billion would be more profitable in the long term than
Apple’s plan of carrying on with “risky and expensive” stock buybacks.
He said it would also be a prudent hedge against inflation.

> “Apple’s management has a unique opportunity to think outside the box.
The company’s loyal ecosystem, technological expertise and financial
strength means that a relatively small risk towards digital could align
it with the most disruptive technology trend since the internet.” As an
aside, the price of BTC would need to rise 545% — roughly $100,000 per
BTC — in order to approach Apple’s current market cap of $2.03 trillion.
