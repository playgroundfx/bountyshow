Feb 28 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has no plans to
unilaterally freeze user accounts in Russia, the company's
representative said on Monday, after Ukraine had asked cryptocurrency
bourses to block operations with Russia.

> "We are not going to unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users'
accounts. Crypto was meant to provide greater financial freedom for
people across the globe," the representative told Reuters.
