LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government has raised
cryptocurrency worth almost $13 million after posting appeals on social
media for donations of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other digital tokens, data from
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analysis firm Elliptic showed on Monday.

Ukraine's official Twitter account made the appeal for cryptocurrency
donations on Saturday following the country's invasion by Russia,
posting digital wallets addresses for tokens including [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and ether
.

Ukraine's Vice-Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted the wallet
addresses. "Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting
cryptocurrency donations," wrote Fedorov, who is also minister of
digital transformation.

The donations came as Russian forces seized two small cities in
southeastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the
Interfax [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) agency said, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as
Moscow's diplomatic and economic isolation deepened.

By 08:50 GMT Monday, the wallet addresses had received crypto worth
$12.8 million across almost 17,300 donations, London-basedÂ Elliptic
said. The company tracks the movement of digital coins on the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), a public ledger that records crypto transactions.

Ukraine's ministry of digital transformation confirmed the tweets were
genuine and added: "How will we use money? To destroy as much Russian
soldiers as possible."

Its crypto crowdfunding appeal is unprecedented. Though some states,
notably El Salvador,has embraced cryptocurrencies, Ukraine's appeal for
direct donations is among the first of its kind.

Crypto donations to Ukrainian volunteer and hacking groups have also
spiked since Russia launched its invasion on Thursday, Elliptic said
this week.

The donations to such groups, some of which have supplied equipment to
government forces, grew strongly in January as Russia massed troops near
Ukraine's border ahead of its invasion.
