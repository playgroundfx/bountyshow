Bitcoin is up 3% over 24 hours to $43,500. Last night, the benchmark
cryptocurrency was down to $41K, where it attracted demand from buyers
on the decline. At this point, buyers are starting to buy back BTC
quickly, which gives some hope.

The coin gets strong support on declines in the $40K area. Over the past
month, Bitcoin has beat off attempts by bears in this area 5 times.
Nevertheless, increased seller intensity may still play against Bitcoin.
Now BTC finally offset the “Chinese [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) factor” and further [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from
the Celestial Empire is likely to have less and less influence on the
price dynamics of the coin.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies is
at 20, which corresponds to the “extreme fear” mode. This is a bullish
buy signal on a rebound for the first cryptocurrency and this market in
general. The RSI index for BTCUSD on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart is in the neutral
zone, showing moderate growth and indicating that there is room for
growth.

Contrary to outside pressures, El Salvador is moving forward with the
incorporation of Bitcoin into the economy. The country’s president
published a video of the installation of volcano-powered ASICs. Clearly,
the country’s government is going ‘all in’ in its experiment on citizens
and the economy. News of such nature, if not causing powerful buying
impulses, certainly maintains a positive mood among participants of the
crypto market.

Nevertheless, if the experiment fails miserably, we may well see an
increase in the negative impact on Bitcoin and then on the entire crypto
sector. It is difficult to unequivocally condemn and advocate for such a
project. It is likely that the success of such an event could be even
more dangerous than the failure, as it would cause several countries to
follow El Salvador’s example. Globally, there are many countries unhappy
with the current world order, the role of the Dollar, and the IMF, but
at this stage, betting on Bitcoin is like betting everything “on the
red” in a casino.

China is doing exactly the opposite, banning everything related to
cryptocurrencies. It has become known that Bitmain, a Chinese
manufacturer of Bitcoin mining ASICs, has stopped selling in their
country. This is very revealing [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), as it is obvious that the Chinese
authorities, after weighing all the pros and cons, came to a total
prohibitionist position. The authorities of Western countries are
usually against such methods, but in practice, they often copy Beijing’s
position, albeit in a different kind of wrapper. It is hard to say what
size the crypto market will be allowed to grow to, but it is obvious
that Chinese-type [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) is getting closer.
