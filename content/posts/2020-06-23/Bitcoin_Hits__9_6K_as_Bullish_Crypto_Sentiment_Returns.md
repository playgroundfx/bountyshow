technicians.

A jump in the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market Monday after days in the doldrums mirrors
the longer-term outlook of Fairlead Strategies’ Katie Stockton, who sees
an upward trend for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market
capitalization. “Bitcoin remains wound up in its consolidation phase, a
reminder why it’s a good idea to await breakouts [and] breakdowns,”
Stockton told CoinDesk. “A breakout continues to appear more likely than
a breakdown from an intermediate-term momentum perspective and would
occur above $10,055 in our work.”

A “consolidation phase” is a term used by technical analysts to mark a
period of indecision by traders overall. In fact, according to data from
[aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Kaiko, volatility of the top free-floating cryptocurrencies
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), ether and XRP has trended down since June 7.

> “Volume has been muted and volatility is getting coiled,” said Neil
Van Huis, director of institutional trading at [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)
Blockfills.

Interestingly enough, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) dominance is down from its 70.5% high in
January 2020 and has flattened during June. This suggests Van Huis’
thesis that alternatives, such as assets on the Ethereum network, might
be of greater interest to traders in June.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and
which powers the Ethereum network, is also jumping today. Ether was
trading around $242 and climbed 5.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00
p.m. ET).

Decentralized lender Compound and the appreciation of its COMP token is
fueling speculative interest, and may be stretching the Ethereum network
to its limits and increasing gas prices. On Jan. 1 of this year, the
average Ethereum network gas price for running [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) code was
11.6 gwei [each gwei is worth 0.000000001 ETH). By June 22 that number
jumped 157% to 29.9 gwei, with decentralized finance (DeFi) attracting
the interest of many traders.

Chan says the demographics of traders on DeFi is shifting and the
increase in tether stablecoin usage is a big factor pointing to the
change. “We’ve seen a significant increase of USDT trading volume,” he
told CoinDesk. “It’s suggesting Asian traders are now pouring into the
DeFi market; the majority was U.S. and Europe before.”

Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are all in the green Monday. The
cryptocurrency winners on the day include iota (IOTA) up 4.1%, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
sv (BSV) climbing 3.8% and qtum (QTUM) jumping 3.6%. All price changes
were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).
