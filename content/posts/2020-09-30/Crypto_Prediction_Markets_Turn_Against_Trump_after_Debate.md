Emerging Ethereum-powered predictions platform Polymarket produced six-
figure volume amid the first presidential debates. The first debate of
the 2020 U.S. presidential election had no clear winner, but crypto-
powered prediction platforms are having a field day.

Election futures on crypto derivatives exchange FTX boomed, with the
platform’s CEO reporting more than $4 million in open interest trying to
pick the winner between Democrat Joe Biden, and Republican Donald Trump.
On FTX, Trump’s brash debate performance got a big thumbs down and drove
a 10% crash in the price of futures contracts backing his re-election.

Volumes on FTX are amplified by leverage. On predictive platforms that
do not offer leverage, more modest six-figure volumes were recorded.
Polymarket saw more than $100,000 in volume flow into its ‘Will Trump
win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?’ market on September 30, with
sentiment similarly shifting against the incumbent president over the
course of the debate. Almost 55 percent believe Trump will not win the
election.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Polymarket founder, Shayne Coplan, said the
platform was designed to find answers to issues “people really want to
know about rather than just things that they want to speculate:”

The platform uses an automatic market maker (AMM) for price discovery,
with all market participants effectively trading against the AMM’s
liquidity pool. Ideas for markets can be submitted from Polymarket’s
users, and are curated by firm’s executives to ensure that the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and
conditions pertaining to specific markets are “unambiguous.”
