The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged VanEck’s
19b-4 Form for its [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 5.87%) exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/))
application on Monday, formally kicking off its 45-day window to make an
initial decision on the proposal. If approved, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) would be the
first open [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded product in the U.S., though there has
long been demand for such a product from the crypto community.
Historically, the SEC has rejected every [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) application,
including VanEck’s past efforts, citing potential for market
manipulation and a host of other concerns.

However, industry pundits believe that the agency may finally be ready
to approve one under incoming Chair Gary Gensler, a former Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who has been fairly bullish on crypto
and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), teaching courses on the technology at MIT in recent
years. VanEck filed for the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) with Cboe BZX Exchange earlier this
year, with Cboe publishing the 19b-4 at the beginning of March. Once the
document is published in the Federal Register (the nation’s logbook),
the general public will have 21 days to submit comments on the SEC’s
portal.

The SEC can extend the review period up to 240 days before it has to
make a final decision. When evaluating past applications, it has always
extended these decisions to their full time limit.
