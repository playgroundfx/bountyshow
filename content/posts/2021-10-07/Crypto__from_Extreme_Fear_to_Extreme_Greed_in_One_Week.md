Bitcoin has passed the major psychological and technical level of $50K
and continues to grow. In the last 24 hours alone, BTC has shown a
growth of 6% and is trading around $55K. Over the week, Bitcoin spiked
by 26%. Another psychological milestone is that Bitcoin’s capitalisation
has overcome $1 trillion. Of course, this figure has a symbolic value,
but for many retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, it is important to see the ability of the
asset to overcome the psychological resistance.

The total capitalisation of the crypto market now is almost $2.3
trillion. In this case, we also see a confident overcoming of the round
value and continuing growth. At this stage of the Bitcoin rally,
alternative cryptocurrencies are showing less significant positive
dynamics. However, altcoins will likely catch up with the first
cryptocurrency given some time. Demand for alternative cryptocurrencies
often increases shortly after Bitcoin’s rise has stopped. The more
expensive Bitcoin is, the more psychologically comfortable altcoins
become for purchase, especially for retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

So far, Bitcoin’s dominance index has increased to 44.5%. The Crypto
Fear & Greed Index has jumped 56 points since last week to 76 and is in
“extreme greed” mode, fully reflecting the sentiment in this market. The
community has growing fears that the $55K-$60K range could slam the door
on bulls and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who have already been buying Bitcoin at the top
of the rally. Should such a scenario materialise, we could see a sharp
reversal as large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who entered the market at the $30K-$40K
range will take profits.

Among the main reasons often highlighted is the statement by SEC head
Gary Gensler that his agency does not intend to ban cryptocurrencies. In
addition, Soros Fund Management has confirmed its investment in Bitcoin.
It seems that at this stage, such statements are enough to launch a
rally. It also cannot be ruled out that the current price surge may be
the result of manipulation.

After Bitcoin reached its all-time high, many crypto market participants
predicted a possible reversal into a broad correction. However, the
bears’ attacks were repelled time after time by those willing to buy the
dip of Bitcoin. As a result, it became clear that the broad growth
impulse is not exhausted, and there may be another stage of the rally,
which will bring the asset, if not above the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum, then
close to it.

In the medium term, it will become clear how fundamentally sustainable
the current stage of the rally is. No matter how bright the current
price dynamics may seem, there is a probability that Bitcoin is now
going through an essential phase of the crossroads, and there is no
certainty that the reached price levels can be maintained.
