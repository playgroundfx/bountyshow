Bitcoin regained some lost ground to trade near $40,000 on Thursday, a
day after a brutal selloff on concerns over tighter [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) in China
and unease over the extent of leveraged positions in the cryptocurrency
world.

The biggest and most popular cryptocurrency rose 10% to a touch above
$40,000, after plunging 14% on Wednesday to its lowest since late
January. Smaller rival ether was up 12% at $2,744 at 1200 GMT, after its
28% tumble.

Those bounces came after prominent crypto backers such Ark Invest’s
Cathie Wood and carmaker Tesla’s Elon Musk indicated their support on
Wednesday.

Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg that she was still sticking to
her $500,000 forecast. Musk reiterated that Tesla was holding on to its
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) investments.

> “People consider this as a ‘buy the dip’ moment, and many consider
this as ‘the last chance to buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) cheap’,” said Ruud Feltkamp,
chief executive at crypto trading bot Cryptohopper. “The next few months
will show if the bull market will continue or if it’s the start of the
end of its run.”

Wednesday’s declines in both digital assets were one of their biggest
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) percentage moves in more than a year, with [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s rushing to
exit trades that until recently were outperforming traditional markets
such as stocks and bonds.

The catalyst was a statement by Chinese financial industry bodies
banning the use of cryptocurrencies in payment and settlement, and
prohibiting institutions from providing crypto-related products or
exchange services between cryptocurrencies and the yuan or foreign
currencies.

> “A defining factor for China’s decision is also likely to be their
strong push towards a central bank digital currency solution,” said
Alexander Ruchti, next-generation research analyst at Julius Baer.

>

> “The past week’s steep and rapid decline once more underpins how
susceptible the segment is towards sentiment swings.”

Bitcoin had been under pressure after a series of tweets last week by
Musk, a major cryptocurrency backer, chiefly his reversal on Tesla
accepting [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as payment.

Analysts said the upheaval was far from over.

The slide forced some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to close out leveraged positions in
cryptocurrency derivatives, which caused prices to fall further and
knocked digital assets down into a lower trading range, traders said.

> “It’s too early to say if the rebound we’ve seen off the lows in
crypto has legs,” said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage
Pepperstone in Melbourne.

>

> “I question if we will get a chance to catch our breath or is there
more volatility in store?”

Weston pointed to how $9.13 billion of cryptocurrency positions had been
liquidated across exchanges over 24 hours, and $532 billion in total
volume transacted.

CROWDED ETHER

Coming off a six-fold jump on the back of rising usage in non-fungible
tokens on digital art platforms, ether’s selloff was far more damaging,
with the digital currency trading 39% below its record highs.

James Quinn, managing director at Q9 Capital, a Hong Kong-based
cryptocurrency private wealth manager, said the selling reflected huge
crowded positions in ether.

Ether is still up more than 270% so far this year, however,
outperforming [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s year-to-date gain of 37%.

> “This can also be the moment when Bitcoin starts reclaiming the market
momentum from ether and other altcoins that have had room to outperform
BTC in the last four months,” said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at
crypto hedge fund ARK36.

While some retail traders saw missed opportunities in the slide, others
saw the rout as a chance to pick up digital assets on the cheap.

Milko Markov, an independent London-based trader, said he had been
buying ether.

> “Those with a bit more experience in the crypto market know two
cardinal rules: don’t leverage and dollar cost average,” he said.
