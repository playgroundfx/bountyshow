Cryptocurrency [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and Facebook-backed Libra could play a role in a
world where central banks globally begin to issue their own digital
currencies, a former top central banker told CNBC’s “Beyond the Valley”
podcast. While both have had their critics, Raghuram Rajan, former
governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said that the two digital
currencies could have a place when central banks enter the fray.

While the idea is still being debated, central banks would likely issue
digital versions of fiat currencies. The People’s Bank of China is
already doing pilots while other central banks are considering whether
to issue their own.

Bitcoin is a “decentralized” cryptocurrency meaning it has no central
authority governing its issuance, unlike fiat currencies. Libra takes a
more centralized approach. It is a project that was proposed by a
Facebook-led consortium of companies last year. But Libra drew heavy
criticism from regulators, particularly because of its ties to Facebook
and its murky track record of data privacy.

The idea is for Libra to be a so-called “stable coin” which would be
backed by a basket of global currencies. That would keep its value
stable in contrast with the volatility that has been seen in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
Libra has scaled down some of its ambitions. Earlier this year, the
Libra Association applied to obtain approval from regulators to issue a
digital currency backed by one currency. That would mean the
consortium’s digital coin may be equivalent to a euro or a U.S. dollar,
for example.

Rajan said that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a “speculative asset” rather than one that is
used for transactions on a large scale. He said [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have often
flocked to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) when traditional assets such as bonds are less
attractive.

> “In that sense, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a little bit like gold, in fact, gold has
some value because we value it for jewelry, but [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) you can’t even
do that. Nevertheless it has value because others think it has value,”
Rajan said.

> “On the other hand, Libra is an attempt to create a currency which is
used for transacting. And that, the whole idea is not to hold it as a
speculative asset which increases in value … but use it for
transactions. So the ultimate underlying value is going to be from the
central banks, they’re going to preserve the value, not of Libra but of
what Libra can be exchanged into,” he added.

One of the big challenges with digital currencies is the amount of data
that comes with them. “Do you trust the central bank as much with
details on every transaction you make? Should the government know? The
beauty of the cash in our hands, is that it’s anonymous. Even if you’re
not doing something illegal you don’t want the government seeing
everything you do,” Rajan said.

> “We need some sort of broader global rules of the game. What are
countries going to do with data collected from abroad on who uses their
currency? How do you make sure that the usual safeguards on that use are
there? If somebody uses a foreign digital currency to buy certain
services which could compromise them, can they be liable to espionage
and blackmail, et cetera? And those are concerns that are not farfetched
in today’s world,” Rajan told CNBC.
