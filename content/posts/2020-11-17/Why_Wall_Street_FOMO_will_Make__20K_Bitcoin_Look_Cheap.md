The year 2020 sucked for pretty much everyone. Unless you’re holding
Bitcoin (BTC) that is. The price of Bitcoin is up 125% year-to-date
making it once again the best-performing asset just as it has been for
the past decade. Strangely enough, the public seems completely oblivious
to this fact. But not everyone is ignoring Bitcoin’s latest rally above
$16,000. Currently, the price is just 20% shy of its all-time high.

![Why Wall Street FOMO will Make $20K Bitcoin Look Cheap][1]

Considering the impressive year Bitcoin is having, it’s not surprising
that Wall Street is now starting to realize that the world’s first
decentralized cryptocurrency isn’t going anywhere. Remember 2017? That
historic Bitcoin price rally was largely driven by retail traders — the
average Joe — who were anticipating a Wall Street stampede alongside the
frenzy of new tokens minted via initial coin offerings.

At the same time, the CME introduced their cash-settled Bitcoin futures
right at the peak in December 2017 and… pop! BTC price dropped sharply
in the following months and the hype fizzled into a multi-year bear
market. Obituaries from the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) media made the average Joe eat the loss
and many wrote Bitcoin off as just another bubble that burst.

But in 2020, the public searches for Bitcoin no longer reflect BTC as
its price has “decoupled.” What’s more interesting is that even Wall
Street still remains largely on the sidelines suggesting that BTC may be
very undervalued at $16,000 and with a market cap of $297 billion.
However, the latest data suggests that this is already beginning to
change.

> “Wall Street is not here yet,” Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron
Winklevoss explained last month. Winklevoss added: “Institutions aren’t
in Bitcoin right now. It’s been a retail phenomenon for the last decade.
So Wall Street talks about it, they’re aware of Bitcoin, but they’re not
really in it from our perspective, but it’s starting to happen.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, it is mainly wealthy areas
in New York and Silicon Valley — home to many high-net-worth individuals
— that are most interested in Bitcoin right now.

But while the public is largely unaware, several wealthy [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
heralding BTC as a new asset class. Paul Tudor Jones, Michael Saylor and
Stanley Druckenmiller have made waves in 2020, revealing their positions
in Bitcoin.

Do they realize something that the public did not in 2017? Was the
average Joe simply too early then? Jones said investing in BTC is like
investing early in Apple stock. Saylor stated that his company,
MicroStrategy, which bought up a total of $425 million in Bitcoin, will
hold it for 100 years calling it “the world’s best collateral.”
Meanwhile, Druckenmiller, the latest big-name Bitcoin convert, now
argues that “If the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work
better.”

Together, these smart money [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are beginning to realize one
thing. As Tyler Winklevoss put it: “Bitcoin is better at being gold than
gold.”

Gold is up just 23% in 2020 during a year of global economic upheaval,
which is when this safe-haven metal was supposed to shine (pun
intended). But Bitcoin, or “digital gold,” has been stealing the show by
gaining 125% year-to-date and up by almost 300% from its coronavirus-
crash lows in March. What’s more, BTC’s market cap is just 2.36% of
gold’s, which some long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see as the best asymmetric risk-
reward ratio bet in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Individuals who bought Bitcoin ten or even five years ago would most
likely agree. With its fixed supply, Bitcoin is becoming particularly
attractive as a hedge against inflation, which is all but guaranteed by
the United States Federal Reserve.

But unlike gold, Bitcoin is absolutely scarce. Its supply is
mathematically fixed and cannot be changed by any authority. What’s
more, the rate at which new BTC is mined is reduced by 50% every 4
years, which analysts argue is one of the biggest catalysts for new bull
market cycles. This event is called the halving with the last one
occurring in May 2020.

Cryptocurrency trader Michael van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin
market is now exiting the Stealth Phase and entering the Awareness
Phase. No longer is BTC just digital money for buying drugs on the dark
web.

According to Van de Poppe:

> “With Stan Druckenmiller, Michael Saylor, and more listed companies
jumping into the Bitcoin markets, it’s quite clear that we’re at the
early stage of a new bull cycle.”

In addition to the halving, the aforementioned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have also
noticed that BTC’s fundamentals, network activity, and on-ramp
infrastructure (e.g. Cash App, PayPal) have all significantly improved
since 2017. So it’s not surprising that this emerging asset class is
starting to look like a no-brainer bet to smart money.

Other [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will also eventually realize that a small allocation of
capital into Bitcoin significantly boosts portfolio returns. Last month,
the co-founder of 10T Holdings, Dan Tapiero, noted:

> “Only 3% BTC position in past 5yrs would have increased performance of
a 60/40 portfolio from 6.8% to 10.2%.”

At this rate, investment fund clients will begin asking questions such
as: why is my nephew’s Bitcoin stash outperforming my 401K, FAANG
stocks, gold, and Warren Buffett put together? How do I gain exposure to
Bitcoin?

But what makes Bitcoin truly unique is that it doesn’t play by Wall
Street’s rules. It’s software with its own set of rules. It is not a
stock or an IPO. It’s a technology that’s open to all and voluntary to
use. It has early adopters, not insiders. It has market cycles, not
bailouts. It has existed for over a decade and grows stronger by the
day.

Despite already existing for nearly 12 years, Bitcoin is only now
starting to be noticed and taken seriously by serious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. At the
same time, it maintains the lowest barrier to entry for everyone else
compared to traditional finance.

This is precisely why Bitcoin still presents a unique opportunity for
the average Joe: to acquire BTC now at lower prices than what Wall
Street will pay for it later.
