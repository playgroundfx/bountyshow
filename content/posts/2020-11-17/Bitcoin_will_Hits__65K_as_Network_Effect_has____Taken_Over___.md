Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $65,000 due to a combination of low supply and
“tons of new buyers,” major [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Mike Novogratz says. In an
increasingly popular Twitter debate on Nov. 17, Novogratz, who is well
known for his prominent Bitcoin plugs, told actress Maisie Williams not
to hesitate in buying the cryptocurrency.

Williams had released a poll asking Twitter followers whether or not she
should invest in BTC. At press time, the verdict was split, with 47% of
the roughly 750,000 responses supporting an investment. The poll soon
caught the attention of famous Twitter users, among them Tesla CEO Elon
Musk. “I bought more BTC last night at 15,800. It’s going to 20K and
(then) To 65K,” Novogratz commented.

> “The network effect has taken over. I see tons of new buyers and there
is very little supply. It’s an easier trade here (than) at 11K. So YES,
buy it.” Williams did not disclose what made her suddenly consider
Bitcoin, with the publicity coming on the back of near 50% monthly gains
for BTC/USD. At press time, the pair circled $16,700.

Other responses included podcast host Stephan Livera, Blockstream chief
security officer Samson Mow, and Barry Silbert, CEO of investment fund
giant Digital Currency Group. Silbert’s asset manager, Grayscale, is
responsible for buying up increasingly large amounts of the Bitcoin
supply, with its holdings passing 500,000 BTC ($8.37 billion) this week.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s recent rise has been noticeable for
the lack of associated media attention it has received. Despite being at
levels not enjoyed by the token longer than two weeks in its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),
Bitcoin has not yet sparked the same frenzy of publicity that
accompanied its rise to $20,000 all-time highs in 2017. Behind the
scenes, however, institutions that were previously unlikely supporters
are coming around to the idea of a future in which Bitcoin stars as a
major investment asset. Among them was Citibank this week, which
forecast a December 2021 Bitcoin price of up to $318,000.
