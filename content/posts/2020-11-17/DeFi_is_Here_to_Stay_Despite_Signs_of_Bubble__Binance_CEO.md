Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the world’s largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)
Binance, said that decentralized finance is here to stay despite many
DeFi projects showing signs of being in a bubble. In a Nov. 17 interview
with Russia’s [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) agency RBC, Zhao argued that “a lot of DeFi projects
are already in a bubble, and I also believe that there are some signs of
a bubble in the DeFi industry, but this does not mean that DeFi will
eventually disappear entirely.”



Zhao went on to say that the DeFi industry has a lot of potential for
growth, noting that DeFi still remains popular amid an ongoing Bitcoin
(BTC) rally. The executive also stressed that initial coin offerings, or
ICOs, were referred to as a bubble back in 2017, but a number of ICO-
born projects — including Binance — are still doing great:

> “Companies create new tokens, issue them as a reward. This is not a
long-running story. But I think DeFi is here to stay. Even now, with
Bitcoin’s popularity rising again, DeFi is still popular. We think there
is a lot of growth potential in DeFi.”

However, Zhao said that some DeFi projects “may not last too long”
despite the industry providing a number of incentives through DeFi yield
farming and DeFi liquidity.
