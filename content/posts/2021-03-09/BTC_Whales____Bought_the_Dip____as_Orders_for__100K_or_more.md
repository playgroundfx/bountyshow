Bitcoin (BTC) whales and institutions alike have made the most of the
recent BTC price “dip” by buying big, data suggests. In an update on
March 9, on-chain analytics service Material Indicators noted that buy
orders of $100,000 and higher on Binance — the biggest cryptocurrency
exchange by volume worldwide — are reaching all-time highs.

In stark contrast to orders worth less than $100,000, larger buys are
more frequent than ever before in Bitcoin’s [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Smaller allocations
have plummeted in 2021, matching an existing narrative that institutions
are scooping up liquidity on exchanges which surfaced during the recent
bull run.

> “The $100k – $1M class is now also about to make a new ATH,” Material
Indicators commented on Twitter alongside a chart. Material Indicators
previously voiced concerns about this week’s price rise, arguing that
whales could “sell into” the surge, producing a repeat of the run to
$58,000 all-time highs and subsequent 25% correction.

While this has so far not come to pass, analysts also noted that
macroeconomic factors were also having a different impact to that which
was expected.

Whale orders declined after [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the United States’ $1.9 trillion
stimulus package had passed the Senate, while China providing support to
tech stocks had the opposite effect. As Cointelegraph reported, tech had
led a dramatic change of fortunes on equities markets.

Later, meanwhile, another batch of nearly 12,000 BTC left professional
trading platform Coinbase Pro as an example of major BTC allocations
continuing at current prices. “That happened just before the recent
surge in price. Nice coincidence,” quant analyst Lex Moskovski commented
on data from fellow on-chain analytics resource Glassnode.
