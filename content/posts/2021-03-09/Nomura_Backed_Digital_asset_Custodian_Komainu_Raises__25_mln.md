LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Komainu, the digital asset custodian backed
by Japanese investment bank Nomura Holdings Inc , has raised $25 million
in a funding round led by veteran hedge fund manager Alan Howard, the
company said on Tuesday.

Other [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the round included Galaxy Digital, NOIA Capital and
Nomura Research Institute, which will act as strategic partners to the
custodian, Komainu said.

Howard is the co-founder of investment firms Brevan Howard, and most
recently [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and cryptocurrency-focused Elwood Asset Management.

Komainu, which safeguards [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s and other cryptocurrencies on behalf
of financial institutions was launched last June as a joint venture
between Nomura, digital asset security firm Ledger, and digital asset
investment house CoinShares.

It has more than $3 billion in assets under custody and will use the
funding to grow its team, develop new technology and expand
geographically, Komainu President Henson Orser said in an interview.

The funding round comes amid a rally in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price, as more
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s warm to the virtual currency which many see as a
hedge against inflation.

Having first established Komainu in 2018, Nomura was one of the earliest
large financial institutions looking to offer services in the nascent
asset class. Since then more mainstream firms have entered or announced
cryptocurrency moves including Fidelity and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc will start trading [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) derivatives on behalf
of clients this month, Reuters reported last week.

Jezri Mohideen, wholesale chief digital officer at Nomura, said in an
interview that the bank decided to start its activities in the sector by
tackling custody because the need for institutional-grade safeguarding
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was one of the largest issues holding back professional
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from the asset.

> “We understood all the pain points and we learned a lot,” Mohideen
said. “We are ready for the next phase of the institutionalization of
the asset class.”
