Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett’s
longtime business partner, on Wednesday dismissed the rocketing share
price of Tesla and the recent [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) frenzy. During an interview at the
Daily Journal’s annual shareholder’s meeting, Munger was asked whether
he thought it was crazier for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to hit $50,000 or for Tesla to
reach a $1 trillion fully diluted enterprise value, he said: “Well I
have the same difficulty that Samuel Johnson once had when he got a
similar question, he said, ‘I can’t decide the order of precedency
between a flea and a louse,’ and I feel the same way about those
choices. I don’t know which is worse.”

Shares of Tesla rocketed 743% last year, though it’s currently down
about 3% for 2021. Its market cap is about $689 billion. Bitcoin
continued to surge to more than $50,000 over the past week after Tesla
announced it bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency.

> Munger was also asked what the biggest threat to banking is, and
whether it was [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) or digital wallets like Apple Pay and Square. “I
don’t think I know what the future of banking is, and I don’t think I
know how the payment system will evolve,” he said. “I do think that a
properly run bank is a great contributor to civilization and that the
central banks of the world like controlling their own banking system and
their own money supplies.” “So I don’t think [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is going to end up
the medium of exchange for the world. It’s too volatile to serve well as
a medium of exchange. And it’s really kind of an artificial substitute
for gold. And since I never buy any gold, I never buy any [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).”
