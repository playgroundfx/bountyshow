Bitcoin (BTC) may be worth almost three times more than at the height of
its 2017 bull run, but a lot of hodlers from that time refuse to sell.
The latest data from Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained Capital
shows that 2017 buyers control an increasingly large amount of the BTC
supply. According to Unchainedâ€™s HODL Waves chart, which ranks the
supply according to when coins last moved, those who bought three to
five years ago are sitting on their investment.

Since the cross-asset crash of March 2020, when BTC/USD fell to lows of
$3,600, the percentage of the BTC supply that last moved between
February 2016 and February 2018 increased from 5.57% to 13.38%. In other
words, the uptrend in price during 2019, much of 2020 and all of 2021
has not made 2017 bull run [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sell after surviving the multi-year
bear market. By contrast, the five to seven-year and seven to ten-year
hodl crowd has been reducing its presence over the past year.

The data counteracts an informal narrative still found online which
claims that Bitcoin breaching $20,000 for the first time since 2017 last
year triggered a mass sell-off from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s desperate to exit at
parity or with a modest profit. As Cointelegraph reported, subsequent
gains produced limited selling beyond the whale [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) crowd, with any
price drips aggressively bought up. HODL Waves likewise confirms that
appetite for Bitcoin has not been dented by price rises beyond $30,000,
$40,000 and even $50,000. A separate cohort, those who bought before
2011, is meanwhile similarly responsible for a larger amount of the
supply. Since March 15, 2020, their share has increased from 6.85% to
10.24%.
