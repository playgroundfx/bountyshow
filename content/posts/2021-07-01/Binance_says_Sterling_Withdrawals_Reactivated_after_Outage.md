LONDON (Reuters) -Major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Binance said on
Wednesday that sterling withdrawals from its platform had been
reactivated, with users also able to buy digital coins with debit and
credit cards.

Binance customers said on Tuesday they were unable to deposit or
withdraw sterling from the platform, days after regulators in Britain
cracked down on some of its activities in the country.

Users of the exchange, one of the world’s biggest, said they were unable
to withdraw or deposit sterling via the Faster Payments network - which
enables mobile, internet and other payments between British bank
accounts - or bank cards.

A Binance spokesperson said withdrawals via the Faster Payments network
were reactivated on Tuesday, adding that bank card purchases of crypto
were again possible.

Many users complained that Binance had given no information about
transactions being blocked, beyond a “down for maintenance” message.

Binance had said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) move would not
impact services offered on its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), access to which by British
residents was unaffected by the crackdown.

Later on Wednesday, the crypto exchange displayed a notice on its
Binance.co.uk [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) stating that Binance Markets Limited, a UK based
company, was not permitted to undertake regulated activities in the
country.

It tweeted the same statement from its Binance.UK twitter handle.
However, Reuters could not find a notice on the Binance.com [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) or
under the Binance twitter handle.

The FCA had told the company to post the notice on Binance.com, its
mobile and desktop applications and social media channels by the close
of business on Wednesday.

Both Binance and the FCA did not immediately respond to requests for
comment.

While crypto trading is not directly regulated in Britain, offering
services such as trading in cryptocurrency derivatives does require
authorisation.

Headed by Canadian Changpeng Zhao, Binance is coming under increasing
scrutiny by regulators globally, many of which have voiced concern over
the use of cryptocurrencies in general for money laundering and other
crimes.

Binance offers services ranging from digital token trading to
derivatives, as well as emerging technology such as tokenised versions
of stocks. Its own cryptocurrency, Binance Coin, is the world’s fourth-
biggest with a market value of around $45 billion.
