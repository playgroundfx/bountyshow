LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial watchdog has barred major
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) Binance from carrying out regulated activities,
the latest in a string of moves against the platform by authorities
across the world.

Here are answers to some key questions on Binance, one of the world’s
biggest exchanges, and what the latest regulatory moves mean.

## HOW BIG IS BINANCE?

Very.

Trading volumes in June were $662 billion, up almost ten-fold from July
2020, according to data from CryptoCompare. On a single day in May,
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volumes hit $92 billion, U.S. researcher Coin Metrics said.

Headed by Canadian Changpeng Zhao, Binance offers a wide range of
services to users across the globe, from crypto spot and derivatives
trading to tokenised versions of stocks.

It also runs an exchange that allows users to trade directly with each
other. Its own cryptocurrency, Binance Coin, is the fourth-biggest in
the world.

Binance is growing in popularity in Britain, where its app has been
downloaded 1.8 million times in 2021, and 2.2 million times in total,
according to mobile data firm Sensor Tower.

## WHERE’S IT BASED?

It’s unclear.

Binance’s corporate structure is opaque, with its holding company widely
reported to be registered in the Cayman Islands. A Binance spokesperson
declined to comment on its location, saying it was “decentralised” and
that it “works with a number of regulated entities around the world”.

Binance has built up a huge following across the world, with channels on
the Telegram social media app for users in more than 30 countries.

## AND IT’S COMING UNDER SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS?

Yes - in Britain and elsewhere.

Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last week Binance’s UK
arm cannot conduct any regulated activity, without saying why it took
the action.

Crypto trading is generally unregulated in Britain, though some
activities such as offering crypto derivatives do require permission.

Regulators including the FCA are increasingly worried over the standard
of anti-money laundering checks at crypto exchanges and the risks crypto
trading poses to consumers.

Japan’s regulator said last week Binance was operating in the country
illegally, while Germany’s watchdog said in April it risked being fined
for offering tokens connected to stocks. In May, Bloomberg reported
Binance is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and
Internal Revenue Service.

Yet national regulators often struggle to rein in crypto exchanges based
elsewhere, lawyers said.

> “It’s very difficult,” said Simon Treacy, senior lawyer at Linklaters.
“(The FCA) don’t have jurisdiction over the whole of Binance’s
operations, so they use the point where they do have jurisdiction and
put pressure on the business there.”

The Binance spokesperson said it takes its compliance obligations very
seriously and is committed to following all regulatory requirements
wherever it operates.

## HOW WILL THE UK MOVE IMPACT BINANCE?

Its influence may be limited.

Beyond a loud warning to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the FCA has done all it can under
its limited powers over an offshore exchange, experts say.

> “At the moment the method is to emphasise risks to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the UK
of these services rather than to regulate them outright,” said Barney
Reynolds, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling.

UK [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can still access Binance via its main [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), which the
FCA does not have powers over.

Still, the FCA’s demand that Binance seeks its permission to offer
regulated services means it would be an offence to suggest to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
it was regulated in the UK.

Binance will also have to rethink plans announced last year to offer
crypto trading services using pounds and euros on a platform regulated
by the UK.

Google said this week it would only allow FCA-authorised entities to run
ads for UK-based financial products on its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), after repeated FCA
calls to crack down on online [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/).

Concern at banks over investment scams and [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) involving crypto
exchanges may also impact Binance. Britain’s Natwest Group last week
capped the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) amount customers can send to exchanges, including
Binance.
