HONG KONG, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell below $43,000 on Thursday,
testing multi-month lows after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last
meeting showed it leaning toward more aggressive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action, which
sapped [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) appetite for riskier assets.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was last at $42,700, down 1.7%,
having lost 5.2% on Wednesday. A break below last month's trough of
$42,000 would make it the weakest since September.

The token hit a record high of $69,000 in November.

The fall "correlated with the 'risk off' move across most traditional
asset classes," said Matt Dibb, COO of Singapore-based crypto fund
distributor, Stack Funds, pointing to the declines in the Nasdaq in
particular.

Moves in cryptocurrency markets are becoming more aligned with those in
traditional markets as the number of institutions trading both crypto
and other assets grows.

The Nasdaq plunged more than 3% overnight in its biggest one-day
percentage drop since February, after Fed minutes showed U.S.
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers had discussed reducing the bank's balance sheet at their
December meeting, when they also decided to accelerate finishing their
bond buying programme.

Share markets in Asia sold off on Thursday as well, while U.S. Treasury
yields edged higher.

Ether , the world's second-largest cryptocurrency which underpins the
[Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) network, lost 5.2% on Wednesday, and touched its lowest level
since October, before bouncing back slightly to $3,460.

Crypto analysts were also watching to see whether anti-government
protests in Kazakhstan, which were initially sparked by rising fuel
prices, would affect the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) network.

The central Asian nation was the world's second-largest centre for
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining, Britain's Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance said
last year.

The Kazakh government late last year began cracking down on some miners,
fearing the energy-intensive process was using too much power.[ ][1]
