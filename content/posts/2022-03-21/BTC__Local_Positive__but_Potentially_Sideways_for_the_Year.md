Bitcoin gained 6.3% over the past week, finishing near $41.3K. The price

Total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, according to CoinMarketCap,
rose 7.5% for the week to $1.86 trillion. The Bitcoin Dominance Index
fell 0.6 points to 41.9% due to outperforming altcoins.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index rose 7 points for the week to 30
and moved into “fear” from “extreme fear”.

Last week turned out to be a good one for the crypto market, with
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rising the most in six weeks. Last Wednesday, the US Federal
Reserve meeting weakened the dollar and boosted stocks, which benefited
all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has continued to trade in a sideways range of $38-45K
for the second month, with a closer look marked by a sequence of
declining local highs with bullish momentum fading near 42 in the last
two weeks. The positive sentiment is supported by the 50-day moving
average reversing upwards. BTCUSD broke it in a relatively strong move
on March 16th, and it has been acting as local support ever since.

The external environment in the financial markets remains mixed. Traders
have tighter financial conditions due to higher rates and waning
economic growth on one side of the scale. On the other side is the
demand for purchasing power insurance for capital due to the highest
inflation in two generations. Weighing these factors, Galaxy Digital
head Mike Novogratz said [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) would continue to trade in a sideways
range this year. He said BTC will resume growth and reach $500K by 2025
as inflation curbing measures are too weak.

Piyush Gupta, chief executive of Singapore’s largest bank, DBS, said
cryptocurrencies could be an alternative to gold but would not be able
to fit into the traditional financial system due to excessive
volatility.
