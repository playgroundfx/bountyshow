At last, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was able to break above the price ceiling that was
keeping it from pursuing a more significant bull run. The benchmark
cryptocurrency jumped above $7,500 this Thursday in a surprising buying
action that pushed the prices up by $704 in just three hours. It topped
at $7,775 on Coinbase before correcting lower during the early Asian
trading session Friday.

The crypto has been able to navigate through the heavy resistance
labeled on the chart seen above. Nevertheless, the interim price rally
paused for a breather, indicating that traders are waiting for a bullish
continuation before they buy [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) at local tops. It may lead to a
sharp pullback to the downside.

As [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) aims to confirm an extended bull run, the cryptocurrency also
has painted a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly accurate and super predictive Golden Cross.
The bullish indicator is formed when an asset’s short-term moving
average closes above its long-term moving average. Bitcoin traders
typically watch 50-[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and 200-[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) MA curves to confirm a Golden
Cross – or its opposite, the bearish Death Cross. But those metrics have
so far proven to be lagging.

The 20-50 MA combo instantly predicts [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s next potential moves. As
of Friday, the 20-[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) EMA is above the 50-[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) SMA, hinting that the
BTCUSD exchange rate is looking to head higher. A similar formation
earlier this year had pushed the pair up by more than 40 percent. On the
flip side, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is still trending higher inside a Rising Wedge
pattern, as confirmed by two converging trendlines. The cryptocurrency
could continue rising until it reaches the shape’s apex. After that, it
could fall by as much as the height of the Wedge, leading it below the
$5,000 level.
