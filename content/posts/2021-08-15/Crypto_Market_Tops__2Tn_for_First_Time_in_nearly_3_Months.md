![Crypto market tops $2 trillion for the first time in nearly 3 months
as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) rallies][1]

Bitcoin topped $48,000 over the weekend, its highest level since mid-May
but pared some of those gains on Monday. On Saturday, the digital coin
hit $48,126.47, its highest level since May 17, according to Coindesk
data. Around 2:49 a.m. ET on Monday, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was trading at $47,442.40
The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) recovery comes after it sold off heavily in June and July,
even dropping below $30,000 following a record high of over $64,000 in
April.

“I do believe this ([bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s rise) is the result of massive
accumulation” when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was trading around $29,000 to $30,000,
according to Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency
exchange Luno. Bitcoin’s rise helped push the value of the entire
cryptocurrency market above $2 trillion on Saturday for the first time
since mid-May, according to data from CoinMarketCap which tracks the
prices of digital coins.

The crypto market has faced a number of headwinds over the summer. One
of the biggest was the renewed regulatory scrutiny on the industry from
authorities in China which has forced [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) mining operations to shut
down and move elsewhere. That was one of the biggest reasons for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
dropping below the $30,000 level. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate passed a
massive infrastructure bill last week without any of the proposed
amendments on crypto tax reporting that had delayed its passage. That
was seen as a blow for the crypto community, but some said it showed the
U.S. government was taking the industry seriously.
