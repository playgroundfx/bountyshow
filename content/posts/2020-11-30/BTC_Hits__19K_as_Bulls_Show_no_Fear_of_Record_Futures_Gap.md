Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $19,000 on Nov. 30 as a weekend surge
continued to produce fresh gains for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and hodlers. Data from
Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaking another
key psychological level during Monday trading.

The weekend had already produced major upside for the pair, which late
last week dived to $16,300. By the start of Monday, $18,600 had
appeared, with Bitcoin going on to deliver returns of at least 17%
versus those lows.

As Cointelegraph reported, a giant $1,300 CME futures gap threatens to
take the market lower, but buyers so far remain unfazed. At press time,
highs above $19,200 were in progress with around half an hour to go
before the start of trading on Wall Street.

Should Bitcoin manage to flip that zone to support, the door remains
open for another attempt at challenging $20,000. Last week, however,
$19,500 provided firm resistance.
