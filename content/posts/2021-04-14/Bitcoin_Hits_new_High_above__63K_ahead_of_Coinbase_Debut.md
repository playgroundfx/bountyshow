Coinbase is set to go public on Wednesday through a direct listing that
could value the company at as much as $100 billion — more than major
trading venue operators like Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New
York Stock Exchange. Crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are hailing the company’s stock
market debut as a major milestone for the industry after years of
skepticism from Wall Street and regulators.

> “This is really good and really important for the industry,” Marcus
Swanepoel, CEO and co-founder of London-based cryptocurrency platform
Luno, told CNBC. “It’s going to increase the trust and transparency in
our industry.” “There’s still a bit of distrust in the industry and I
think having a company of that size be public is going to help a lot of
people realize that this is not just an asset class to take seriously
but also a business to take seriously.”

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) in the
United States. It’s seen surging revenues this year thanks to a climb in
the value of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies. The company reported
estimated revenues of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a nine-
fold increase from the same period a year earlier, while profits grew to
between $730 million and $800 million.
