Ether (ETH) returned to $500 for the first time in more than two years
on Nov. 20 as altcoins slowly staged a comeback from poor performance.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed ETH/USD
briefly hitting the psychologically significant barrier in Friday
trading before a rejection halted progress.

Despite being capped at roughly 6% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) gains at press time, Ether’s
achievement delighted traders, who noted that overall in 2020, the
largest altcoin has outperformed even Bitcoin (BTC). Year-to-date
returns stand at 284% for Ether and 155% for Bitcoin.

Versus the pit of its price lows in mid March, just after the
coronavirus-induced cross-asset crash, Bitcoin was still the strongest
player. At the time, ETH/USD traded at just $117, making Friday’s levels
an increase of 327%, while BTC/USD gained 411% from $3,600 to $18,420.

Alongside the $500 visit — Ether’s first since June 2018 — other major
altcoins also showed signs of life, notably Litecoin (LTC), which with
12% gains outperformed Bitcoin on the day, and is the only major altcoin
to outperform BTC in the past month — by 7%.
