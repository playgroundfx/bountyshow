Cryptocurrency wallet provider Phantom has secured $9 million in Series
A financing to launch a new multi-chain wallet designed to help DeFi
users access decentralized applications across multiple [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s. The
raise comes on the heels of a successful beta launch in April of this
year that saw 40,000 new Phantom users. The company also secured
$500,000 in grants from Serum and Solana during the beta phase. Brandon
Millman, Phantom’s co-founder and CEO, said his platform enables users
to easily access decentralized exchanges and nonfungible token
platforms, explaining:

> “With the world moving into a multi-chain future, the strong interest
from the participants in our beta group indicates that our team has
designed a DeFi wallet for the masses, one that’s in a unique position
to provide value to users unlike any other related product on the
market. Cryptocurrency wallets are the first point of [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) for DeFi
users, but the steep learning curve around their use may be impacting
broader mainstream adoption. Phantom has prioritized simplicity in
onboarding more wallet users. The Phantom application can be installed
as a browser extension on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and
Firefox.
