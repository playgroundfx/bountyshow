SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s banking watchdog said it was examining
the regulatory implications of Commonwealth Bank’s’s planned
introduction of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading to unsophisticated retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s -
the first bank in Australia to do so.

CBA says it would welcome a clear regulatory framework for
crytpocurrencies, which are not formally regulated in Australia.

On Wednesday CBA broke banking industry ranks to match offerings from
fintech firms by announcing it will become the first main-street bank in
the developed world to offer a platform for retail customers to trade
cryptocurrencies.

The move is forcing financial watchdogs in Australia to immediately
focus on the volatile $2 trillion crypto trading industry that many
argue has no intrinsic value and relies on users’ complete trust in
different types of software.

A spokesman for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
told Reuters the country’s largest lender had made the regulator aware
of its plans and the authority was “examining regulatory issues that
this raises”.

After a staged pilot for 2,000 people, CBA will give easy access to
crypto trading in 10 assets to about a third of Australian adults
already using its industry-leading mobile banking app, which also offers
energy retailers discounts and carbon emission trackers.

CBA’s crypto trading service will be provided in partnership with Gemini
Trust Company, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges that was
created in 2014 by the Winklevoss brothers, famous for accusing
Facebook’s founder of stealing their idea.

The anti-money laundering watchdog the Australian Transaction Reports
and Analysis Centre said that it was “engaging ... in relation to this
new product offering” with both CBA and Gemini.

CBA says it would welcome regulatory clarity in the space, and that its
product was designed with risk-mitigation and regulatory concerns front
of mind for both the bank and to ensure people feel safe when using the
product.

> “We would really welcome regulatory clarity for crypto assets. We
think it would improve the market, enhance trust and it would raise the
bar in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of customer protection,” said Sophie Gilder, Commonwealth
Bank’s head of Blockchain and the bank’s project leader.

CBA’s offering will be a “a closed loop” connected to a CBA bank
account, that would be monitored with cryptocurrency anti-money
laundering services from Chainalysis for any potential suspicious
activity.

> “We’ve got complete transparency as to customer activity and can
report on that to regulators when necessary,” Gilder said, which
includes customary reporting to the taxation authority.

>

> “We will not, as soon as the pilot ends, open it to everyone. It will
be a more gradual process than that, which I think is appropriate
considering the volatility of crypto.”
