Bitcoin remains sideways, barely moving out of the $60-63.5 range for
the past two weeks. A dip towards the lower end of the range late on
Friday morning has been redeemed, and the BTCUSD exchange rate has
returned to $62.2K. Interestingly, the price surge to the highs of
October 20 was later counterbalanced by a proportional dip, making the
area near $61.50K the centre of equilibrium for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) over the past
four weeks.

A similar balancing act can be seen in the cryptocurrency Fear and Greed
Index, which has been moving at levels just above 70 since early
October, showing a mark of 73 in the last 24 hours, firmly in Greed
territory.

Against the backdrop of Bitcoin stabilisation and cryptocurrency
“greed”, interest in altcoins continues to rise. Cryptocurrency market
capitalisation ex BTC has added 26% over the past month, although it has
faced several sharp declines.

Among the week’s top coins, Binance Coin ( 21.7% in 7 days), Solana (
21.7%) and Polkadot ( 22.6%) shone. On the other hand, Dogecoin was
depleted by the battle, with Dogecoin losing 9.5% and Shiba Inu losing
28%.

Bitcoin’s steady burn at one level is feeding risk appetite among crypto
enthusiasts.

Bitcoin seems to have become so liquid and inert, and demand has gone so
much into the ‘new stars’ that it hasn’t even been moved upwards by the
latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from New York. A man who promised to turn the city into a
crypto hub was elected mayor there. And yesterday, he said he would get
his first three salaries in BTCs. Of course, there is no economic effect
in the latter, but it would have had an important psychological impact a
year ago, noticeably pushing the price upwards.

Do Bitcoin’s inertia and the failure of last week’s two doglegs mean the
end of this bullish wave? So far, it’s hardly a valid thesis: active
speculators in the cryptocurrency market are jumping from one coin to
another, trying to ride the small (in volume but not height) waves. This
is a positive-sum game if the tide is turning, that is, if the overall
capitalisation of the crypto market is rising.

When will the tide turn? That depends on the global demand for risk,
which correlates with central bankers’ stance and inflation trends.
Recent comments from central bankers have made it clear that regulators
continue to look the other way on inflation, expecting it to subside on
its own without raising interest rates. This is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for
cryptocurrencies with limited supply, such as Ether.

At some point, the tide will turn, and then those currently riding the
high tide risk finding themselves far out in the shallows. However, that
moment is in no hurry to arrive.
