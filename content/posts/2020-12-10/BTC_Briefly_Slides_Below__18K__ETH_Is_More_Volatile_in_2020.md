The price of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) once again fell below $18,000 Thursday, going as
low as $17,904 according to the CoinDesk 20. The price was able to
reverse course, with higher volume pushing it back up to $18,349 as of
press time.

Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial, pegs
$17,900 as a “support” level whereby if traders don’t start scooping up
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) to push price back up, there may be a larger fall. “The trend is
weakening,” Kogan told CoinDesk. “If we dip further then I will consider
that as a start of a downtrend.”

Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank, has noticed a
lull in the market this week but sees it as a buying opportunity for
those who have a longer time frame. “I’m not scared by this. It’s just
providing a better entry point for those who want to invest mid-long
term,” said Thomas to CoinDesk. “I haven’t seen much [over-the-counter]
or larger activity this week, though.”

At a combined $1.1 billion as of Wednesday’s close, average weekday spot
volume on major CoinDesk 20 exchanges is lighter this week than last
week’s $1.7 billion. As of press time, combined volumes were at $873
million Thursday.

Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trader, is not
dismayed by the doldrums in the crypto market this week. “It’s a
moderate dip on the way up,” Kugelberg told CoinDesk. “Nothing to see
here.”

Rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies has been a popular theme in
the crypto market as of late, and Swissquote’s Thomas pointed to XRP as
one example of this dynamic. “Our data shows that in the last four weeks
the volume of XRP has increased substantially at the detriment to ether
and a little bit [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),” Thomas said.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was
down Thursday, trading around $566 and slipping 1.1% in 24 hours as of
21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). The 30-day volatility for ether for the most
part has been higher than for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in 2020, according to data
collected by CoinDesk Research.
