Bitcoin (BTC) miners appear to be selling large amounts of BTC once
again. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the BTC Miners’ Position Index —
a metric tracking the ratio of BTC leaving miners’ wallets — achieved a
three-year high. This trend indicates that miners are likely selling BTC
on over-the-counter (OTC) or spot exchanges.

On Dec. 10, two large miner-linked Bitcoin transactions were spotted
right as the Miner’s Position Index abruptly spiked to levels unseen
since 2017, according to data from CryptoQuant. First, around 800 BTC
moved to Binance, which is worth $14.5 million. Second, 11,852 BTC moved
to an unknown cold wallet, which is equivalent to $215.9 million.

Miners typically sell Bitcoin through spot or OTC exchanges. When a
sell-off occurs on spot exchanges, it could intensify the near-term
selling pressure on BTC. The impact on BTC price is not as immediately
felt when miners sell on OTC exchanges since they are directly selling
to buyers.

In May, Cointelegraph reported that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)
had been accumulating more Bitcoin than mined. In recent months,
Grayscale has continued adding to its reserves to pass $10 billion
Assets Under Management. If this trend remains intact, it can help
offset the selling pressure from miners and whales in the short to
medium [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

In October, Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, said Bitcoin
could also face a potential supply crisis as a result. Miners could
cause a short-term Bitcoin pullback, but BTC repeatedly failed to
surpass the $19,600 resistance level. Hence, an argument could be made
that the sell-off from miners comes during a period when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
already anticipated a sharp correction. Moreover, on-chain indicators
such as the low exchange inflows and Bitcoin exchange reserves at the
lowest level since August 2018 could also offset near-term bearishness
and prevent BTC from dropping further to $16,000 and possibly lower.
