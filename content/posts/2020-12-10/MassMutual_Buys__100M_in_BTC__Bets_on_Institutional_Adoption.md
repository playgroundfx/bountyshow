Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. is jumping into the
institutional [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) game with a $100 million investment in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and
a $5 million equity stake in NYDIG. The twin plays – both revealed in a
Thursday press release – give MassMutual direct exposure to the
cryptocurrency’s price swings and signal it’s betting that other big
fish will follow suit. NYDIG is one of the fastest-growing institutional
crypto shops with $2.3 billion under management. It provided MassMutual
with the $100 million buy.

Without specifically explaining why it saw [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as a reasonable
investment, MassMutual told the Wall Street Journal it was seeking
“measured yet meaningful” exposure to an increasingly digital world.
MassMutual’s $100 million BTC bet is barely a drop in its general
investment account’s hulking $235 billion money bucket. Coming from a
169-year-old insurance institution in the business of measuring risk it
could wield an outsize influence on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s perception among
mainstream [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The life insurance company is the latest institutional stalwart to join
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s march into the financial mainstream this year. Since the
pandemic took hold, publicly traded corporations and storied fund
managers have been embracing the cryptocurrency at a pace not seen at
any other point in its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

But with its dual investment in NYDIG, the firm that facilitated this
buy, MassMutual is moving to embrace the infrastructure powering
institutional adoption.

NYDIG has been forthright in its courting of the institutional class.
Wednesday, the firm hired crypto banker Patrick Sells to lead its
crypto-services outreach efforts. It regularly raises tens of millions
of dollars for crypto funds, including a $100 million [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) fund filed
over Thanksgiving. That mammoth vehicle, which CoinDesk reported at the
time, only had a single [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).
