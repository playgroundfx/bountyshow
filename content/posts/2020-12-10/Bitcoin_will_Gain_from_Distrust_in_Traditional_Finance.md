Bitcoin (BTC) poses a significant threat to the world’s reserve
currency, the United States dollar, according to a strategist at major
American investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ruchir Sharma, chief global
strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, believes that the
dollar’s reign is likely to end due to global distrust in traditional
finance, while Bitcoin is likely to capitalize on that lack of
confidence.

In a Dec. 9 article in The Financial Times, Sharma provided a brief
outline on the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the world’s reserve currencies, noting that
the dollar’s run had lasted 100 years at the start of 2020. According to
the strategist, other major global fiat currencies like the euro or
China’s yuan have failed to gain the world’s trust, underlining the lack
of a successor for the dollar.

Sharma said that a new class of decentralized contenders —
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — are likely to threaten the dollar’s
supremacy. Bitcoin has already established itself as one of the hottest
investments of 2020 by quadrupling in price since March amid the
pandemic and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued money printing, he
noted:

> The strategist warned central banks to pay more attention to their
monetary policies if they want to maintain their position of power:
“Bitcoin’s surge may still prove to be a bubble, but even if it pops,
this year’s rush to cryptocurrencies should serve as a warning to
government money printers everywhere, particularly in the U.S. Do not
assume that your traditional currencies are the only stores of value, or
mediums of exchange, that people will ever trust.”
