Three months after seemingly changing course on crypto, the outspoken
host of CNBC’s Mad Money is claiming he made a well-timed Bitcoin
investment on Friday. In an interview with TheStreet, Jim Cramer says he
purchased Bitcoin (BTC) Friday morning when the price dipped under
$18,000. The Mad Money host added he was treating the crypto asset as
any other investment in a diverse portfolio.

> “I will buy — like I usually do — as something comes down,” said
Cramer. “I’ll get bigger and bigger and bigger. I just think that you
want to diversify into all sorts of asset classes. I have gold. I’m
going to diversify into some Bitcoin — not a big position for me — but
it’s certainly important to be diversified, and Bitcoin is an asset and
I want to have a balance of assets.”

Cramer said he believed the price of Bitcoin might “come down again”
given its volatile [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). However, he personally saw the $17,000s —
the price when he claimed to purchase more BTC — as a “decent level”:

The CNBC host was once an outspoken Bitcoin critic prior to the 2017
boom, saying that the crypto asset was going to “run out of steam.
However, since being a guest on Bitcoin bull Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano’s
podcast in September, Cramer has said he might invest 1% of his
portfolio in Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is $19,192 at the time of
publication, having risen 2.6% in the last 24 hours.
