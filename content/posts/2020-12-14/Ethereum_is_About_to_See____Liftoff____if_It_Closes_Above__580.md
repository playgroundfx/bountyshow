ETH price found support near $535 and started a steady recovery against
the US Dollar. The price is currently trading above $560 and the 100
simple moving average (4-hours). There is a crucial contracting triangle
forming with resistance near $570 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD (data

![Ethereum is About to See “Liftoff” if It Closes Above $580][1]

The pair could rise sharply if there is a clear break above $570 and
$580. This past week, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and [Ethereum](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/the-creator-of-ethereum/) saw a downside extension
below $18,000 and $550 respectively against the US Dollar. ETH price
even spiked below the $540 support and settled below the 100 simple
moving average (4-hours).

However, the bulls were able to protect the $530 support zone. A swing
low was formed near $535 and the price recently started a steady upward
move. There was a clear break above the $550 resistance level.

Ether price also surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward
move from the $578 swing high to $535 swing low. It is now trading near
the $570 resistance zone and above the 100 simple moving average
(4-hours). There is also a crucial contracting triangle forming with
resistance near $570 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD.

The triangle resistance is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of
the downward move from the $578 swing high to $535 swing low. The next
major resistance and a key breakout zone sits near the $580 level.

A successful break above the $570 resistance and a follow up move above
the $580 level could start a strong increase. The next major resistance
is near $600, above which it could rise towards the $620 level.

Fresh Decline in Ether (ETH)?  
If Ethereum fails to clear the $570 and $580 resistance levels, there is
a risk of another bearish reaction. An initial support is near the $555
level.

The first major support zone sits near the $550 level and the triangle
lower trend line. A downside break below the triangle support might lead
the price towards the $535 support zone.
