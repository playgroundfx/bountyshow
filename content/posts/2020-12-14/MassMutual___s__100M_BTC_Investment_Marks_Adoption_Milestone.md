> “MassMutual’s [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, -0.98%) purchases represent another
milestone in the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) adoption by institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,”
JPMorgan’s strategists said, according to Bloomberg on Monday. “One can
see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as other
insurance companies and pension funds follow MassMutual’s example,” they
added.

On Thursday, the 169-year old insurance firm announced [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) purchases
worth $100 million, as well as a $5 million equity stake in NYDIG – a
financial services firm focused on [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) with $2.3 billion in the
asset under management.

MassMutual’s move suggests insurance firms and pension funds are
beginning to look at [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) as an investment/reserve asset alongside
increased demand from wealthy [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and family offices.

According to JPMorgan, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may find an additional demand of $600
billion if pensions insurance firms in the U.S., EU, U.K. and Japan
allocate 1% of assets to the top cryptocurrency.
