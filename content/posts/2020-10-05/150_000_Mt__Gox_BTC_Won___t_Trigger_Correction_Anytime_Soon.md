There is growing speculation that 150,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from the Mt. Gox
trustee could move on Oct. 15. But many factors suggest that is highly
unlikely given past records. Between 2011 and 2013, Mt. Gox lost 850,000
BTC in the biggest hacking attack in Bitcoin [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The trustee
reportedly has 150,000 BTC to repay users who lost their funds from the
breach.

Yet, there are many hurdles to undergo before the refunds can be issued.
The refund process has been continuously delayed since 2019, and the
refunds won’t likely happen anytime soon. On Jun. 30, the Mt. Gox
trustee released a statement on the official Mtgox.com [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). The
trustee, in charge of redistributing the funds to former users, said the
Tokyo District Court granted a deadline extension to Oct. 15. The
document read:

> “In light of the foregoing, the Rehabilitation Trustee filed a motion
to seek an extension of the submission deadline of the rehabilitation
plan at the Tokyo District Court, and, on June 30, 2020, the Tokyo
District Court issued an order to extend the submission deadline for the
rehabilitation plan to October 15, 2020.”

Based on this document, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have suggested it could cause
150,000 BTC to move, potentially rattling the market. But there are two
key reasons the trustee would not move the Bitcoin in the near term.

First, the extension pertains to submitting the rehabilitation plan, not
refunding the BTC. Simply put, the Oct. 15 deadline is for the trustee
to put forward a plan, not to refund [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Second, the trustee has continuously requested extensions throughout the
past year. An identical statement was put out in March 2020 and in April
2019, and deadline extensions were granted.

Oct. 15 is not the actual deadline for user refunds and the trustee has
delayed the process several times in the past. Based on these two
factors, it is safe to presume that the 150,000 BTC from the Mt. Gox
trustee won’t hit markets in the short term.
