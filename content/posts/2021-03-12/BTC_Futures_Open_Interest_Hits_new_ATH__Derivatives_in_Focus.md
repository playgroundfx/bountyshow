With BTC again edging toward all-time highs, a large volume of money is
flowing into the Bitcoin derivatives markets. According to crypto market
data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Glassnode, outstanding futures contracts pushed into new
all-time highs on March 11, with open interest across exchanges
approaching $20 billion. Options have also surged to see record volumes
in 2021, with Derebit now regularly hosting more than $1 billion worth
of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trade. According to Binance-owned CoinMarketCap, the three-
largest centralized derivatives exchanges — Binance, Huobi Global, and
ByBit — represent more than $100 billion in combined [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trade.
Binance alone is $57 billion. The next ten highest-ranked exchanges
facilitated more than $65 billion in trade over the past 24 hours.

However, despite the surging volumes, some decentralized derivatives
exchanges appear to be struggling to attract the momentum of their
centralized counterparts. Skyrocketing Ethereum fees appear to have
slowed the growth of decentralized [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), with the complicated smart
contract executions required to interact with some Ethereum-based
protocols resulting in gas prices of more than $1,000.

Similarly record fees also appear to have deterred traders from
Ethereum-powered decentralized futures, with [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume on dYdX
plummeting from tens of billions in January to roughly $100 million over
the past week. Recent liquidity issues on the popular on-chain [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
trading protocol Hegic are also impacting Etherum’s decentralized option
markets.
