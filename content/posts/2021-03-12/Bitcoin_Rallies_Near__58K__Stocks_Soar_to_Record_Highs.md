The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market is back in bull mode but for one key attribute,
almost like a missing tooth: low trading volume. Bitcoin’s price on
Thursday extended its winning streak to a seventh day as a renewed
appetite for risk-taking in traditional markets sent U.S. stocks to new
record highs. The catalyst was a U.S. government report on Wednesday
showing a slower-than-expected inflation rate in February, which
assuaged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ concerns that fast-rising consumer demand might send
prices shooting higher as the economy reheats.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,
was up on Thursday, trading around $1,812.13 and climbing 0.26% in 24
hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). The correlation between [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
and ether is trending downward again after rising for about two weeks
starting Feb. 21. Compared with the same time period a year ago, the
correlation between the No. 1 and No. 2 cryptocurrencies by market
capitalization is slightly weaker, dropping to about 0.74 from 0.94.
