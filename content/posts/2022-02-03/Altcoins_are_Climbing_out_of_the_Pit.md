Down the chain, US stock market dynamics now determine corporate
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment towards Bitcoin and Ether. From the top-down, this
sentiment then spreads down to altcoins.

But since late last year, there has been a continuing trend that even
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s calming is enough for altcoins to return to growth and
outperform the first cryptocurrency.

In the last 24 hours, the entire crypto market has added 3.3%, while
Ether has gained 4.7% versus Bitcoin’s 2.4%. Ether has strengthened by
15% in the last seven days, returning to this month’s highs and trying
to climb above the bottom levels at the end of September 2021.

The cryptocurrency market capitalisation excluding Bitcoin has been
hovering around the $1 trillion mark for over a week and approached the
upper end of that range on Friday morning. The reduction in volatility
in Bitcoin allows for an optimistic outlook on altcoins. At least in the
short term.

An essential boundary for Ether will be the $3K mark. A return in the
price above this level could further encourage buyers and reject the
idea of a crypto-winter following the example of 2018.

Solana is showing signs of coming out of the hole it fell into at the
end of January. The $90 mark has attracted sufficient buyer demand.
However, it will be premature to discuss a sustained recovery to the
upside, only a stabilisation after the collapse.

A BTCUSD consolidation above $40k and Ethereum above $3k would shift the
altcoin recovery to a new speed and restart the process of BTC share
contraction in the entire market.
