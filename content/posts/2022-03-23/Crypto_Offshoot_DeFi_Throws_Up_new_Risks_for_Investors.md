LONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - Decentralised finance - or DeFi - is
throwing up new risks for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as it evolves to mirror traditional
markets, a global body for securities regulators said on Thursday,
adding to a chorus of warnings about the fast-growing crypto offshoot.

So-called DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow and save in digital
assets, bypassing the traditional gatekeepers of finance such as banks
and exchanges.

Backers say they open up financial services for swathes of consumers and
businesses that otherwise struggle to access loans or other products.
The DeFi sites became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as rock-
bottom interest rates pushed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to search for yield.

Most DeFi services replicate more traditional financial services and
activities, but with weaker [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and increased risks for
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, IOSCO, made up of securities regulators from the United
States, Europe and Asia, said in a report.

IOSCO highlighted risks surrounding DeFi, including lack of disclosure
of products and systems, patchy reliability of the DeFi sites and
potential problems in operating at scale.

DeFi sites claim to be "decentralised" with no single entity exerting
control, but IOSCO said professional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s or venture capitalists
often have a strong say on governance or retain ultimate control.

In addition, centralised trading platforms that offer DeFi services,
such as trading, lending and borrowing, may also have potential
conflicts of interest, IOSCO said, without giving further details.

The value of crypto on DeFi platforms hit a record of more than $111
billion in November, mirroring record highs for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and now stands
at around $80 billion, based on data site DeFi Pulse.

Regulation of DeFi, like cryptocurrencies in general, remains patchy,
even though the sector is attracting more mainstream [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. DeFi has
also been used for scams and other crimes.

The Financial Stability Board, a risk monitoring watchdog for the G20
economies, said last month DeFi could present risks to financial
stability without [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and oversight.
