BTC rose 3.5% on Tuesday. At the peak of the day, the rate exceeded
$43.2K, but by Wednesday morning it rolled back to $42K, demonstrating a
0.7% correction. Ethereum is losing 1% over 24 hours, while other
leading altcoins from the top ten showed mixed dynamics yesterday: from
a decline of 2.7% (Avalanche) to a rise of 3.8% (Polkadot).

market decreased by 0.5%, to $1.91 trillion. The Bitcoin dominance index

inflation. At the same time, there are no clear signs of an economic and
financial catastrophe that could hurt stocks or commodities.

The world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates plans to invest in
one of the third-party crypto funds, pointing to the risks for fiat
currencies, which lose sharply during periods of military and economic
wars.
