Bitcoin (BTC) advocates are warning of money losing all sense of value
as the United States weighs yet another giant stimulus package. The U.S.
would spend $400 billion on new stimulus measures to pay every adult
$2,000 a month pocket under a new government plan.

In a live stream on April 14, two Democrat congressmen have submitted
the Emergency Money for the People Act, which would ensure a universal
basic income for Americans over 16 for at least half a year. “We’ve got
to put money in the pockets of people who have lost income,” one of the
congressmen, Ro Khanna, explained during the live stream. “And we have a
bill that says you’re going to get up to 2,000 bucks — not just one
time, but for six months.”

The move comes as checks from the U.S.’s first round of cash handouts
begin hitting bank accounts. Worth $1,200 or $500 for children, the one-
off payments cover the majority of U.S. citizens, with President Donald
Trump insisting the checks bear his name. At the same time, controversy
abounds after it emerged that banks are able to confiscate the money if
the recipient has debt obligations.

Bitcoin users had already widely panned the plans, which many see as a
further move towards government economic meddling that some suggest
facilitated the coronavirus crisis to begin with. “The Rubicon has been
crossed. Even surprises me and I have been a strong advocate for extreme
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response, ‘unlimited,’ in the face of economic collapse,” Gold
Bullion International co-founder Dan Taperio tweeted on Thursday,
adding: “Soon will be difficult to value money. If so, all society’s
values realign. Expect volatility.” Several weeks ago, a Federal Reserve
representative admitted publicly that the bank had “unlimited” money.
