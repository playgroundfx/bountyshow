The total market value of cryptocurrencies surpassed $1 trillion for the
first time Thursday amid a frenzied and volatile rally in Bitcoin to yet
another record. Cryptocurrencies hit the milestone after a fivefold
climb in market value in the past year, data from tracker CoinGecko
shows. Strategists have cited demand from speculative retail traders,
trend-following quant funds, the rich and even institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
as among the reasons for the surge.

Bitcoin rose as much as 6% on Thursday to touch a high of $38,169 and
has more than quadrupled in the past year, according to a composite of
prices compiled by Bloomberg. It accounts for about two-thirds of
cryptocurrency market value, followed by Ether at about 13%, according
to CoinGecko data.

Digital coins are jumping in a world awash with fiscal and monetary
stimulus, even as some commentators fear an inevitable bust and others
question the basic integrity of crypto markets. Proponents of Bitcoin
argue it offers a hedge against dollar weakness and the risk of faster
inflation, a bit like gold, while critics decry the intellectual
soundness of comparing the two assets.

> “The more that people perceive that their assets, particularly their
liquid assets such as fiat currencies are eroding in value, the more
they will look for alternatives,” said Geoffrey Morphy, president of
Canadian crypto mining company Bitfarms Ltd.

Active Bitcoin accounts are nearing their all-time high levels of late
2017, according to researcher Flipside Crypto — possibly a sign that
some holders are planning to sell. Fewer than 2% of accounts hold 95% of
Bitcoin supply, so a few big trades can impact prices. The last big
Bitcoin boom began imploding in late 2017.
