The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH,
7.29%) and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC, 9.46%) – a measure of the expected relative
price volatility between the two – has risen to a record high of 46%.
That surpasses the previous peak of 45% seen on Feb. 21, 2020, according
to data provider Skew. The three- and six-month spreads have risen to an
11-month high of 32% and 23%, respectively.

Ahead][1]

The widening of the IV spreads indicates that the market expects ether
and other alternative coins to chart bigger percentage moves than
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) in the near term. “Traders are expecting increased volatility
for ether relative to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),” Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.
“This is consistent with decreasing correlation and a pick-up in
interest across alternative cryptocurrencies.”

Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile
an asset would be over a specific period and is driven by net buying
pressure for [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price volatility. Ether is the
second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, and many other so called
altcoins are based on Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. As such,
alternative cryptocurrencies tend to trade in line with ether.

The one-month spread has seen a five-fold increase since Dec. 30,
alongside a weakening positive correlation between ether and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).
The three-month realized correlation has declined from 67% to 56% in the
past five days to hit the lowest level since March 2018, according to
data source Skew. The trend looks set to continue, as suggested by the
widening of the IV spreads.

While rising volatility spread implies scope for relatively bigger
percentage moves in altcoins, it does not tell us anything about the
direction of the moves.

That said, alternative cryptocurrencies are now looking cheap compared
to [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the market is extremely bullish. So alts could soon be
charting bigger percentage gains than the crypto market leader [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
as predicted by analysts earlier this week.

Despite having rallied from $700 to $1,200 this month, ether is still
nearly 20% short of its record high of $1,432.88 reached in January
2018. Similarly, [Litecoin](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/litecoin-creator/) (LTC, 3.74%), stellar (XLM, -13.05%),
chainlink (LINK, 6.11%) and other prominent coins are yet to set new
lifetime highs. At its current price of over $37,000, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is up over
60% from the previous lifetime high of $19,783 registered three years
ago.
