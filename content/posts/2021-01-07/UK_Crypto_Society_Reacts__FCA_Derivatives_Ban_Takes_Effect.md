On Wednesday, the decision by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority to ban crypto futures and exchange-traded notes finally went
into effect. The FCA initially announced the ban back in October 2020
following a year-long consideration of the matter. At the time, the FCA
argued that crypto derivatives were ill-suited to retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who
were at risk of incurring significant losses.

Commenting on the decision as the ban went into effect on Wednesday, Ian
Taylor, chair of the self-regulatory trade group CryptoUK, told
Cointelegraph: “The regulator is clearly focused on consumer protection,
and rightfully so. Derivatives allow for leverage — enabling [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to magnify their gains, but equally their losses. The FCA has raised
concerns about retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s being exposed to significant losses and
volatility, that they may not fully appreciate.”

However, Taylor faulted the FCA’s characterization of retail crypto
derivatives [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as unsophisticated. The CryptoUK chair also
remarked that the FCA could have opted for stricter leverage limits
similar to the restrictions placed on contracts for differences, rather
than placing a blanket ban.

With the ban in place, crypto derivatives can no longer be included in
individual savings accounts, or ISAs and self-invested personal
pensions, or SIPPs. However, there are concerns that the move might push
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s towards unregulated offerings in other jurisdictions that pose
even greater risks to retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s than the products previously on
offer in the U.K.
