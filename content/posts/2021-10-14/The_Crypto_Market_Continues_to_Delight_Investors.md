At one point yesterday, Bitcoin went into a correction, but it was
short-lived. The bulls won, not only buying back the decline but also
sending Bitcoin to new highs since May. Bitcoin is up 4.5% in the last
24 hours and is trading at $58,000. Over the previous seven days, BTC
was up 6%. The Bitcoin dominance index has paused and is now at 45.8%.
This is a positive sign as it indicates a stronger demand for
alternative cryptocurrencies.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index is at 70, which corresponds to
the greed mode, indicating that there is still room for further growth.
It is probably quite limited as, on the other hand, the RSI index for
the BTCUSD pair on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart shows dangerous proximity to an
overbought level.

The alternative cryptocurrency market is also showing a very positive
end to the working week. The major coins are rising following the market
leader. Demand for altcoins often grows following the exhaustion of
Bitcoin’s growth momentum, but in this case, it could be about broad
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in the entire cryptocurrency market. Altcoins are
probably attracting more interest from the retail sector. For them,
buying altcoins is a more psychologically comfortable investment due to
the lower nominal price and the belief in the growth potential of new
names.

On the bright side was the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the US has become the global leader
in Bitcoin’s hash rate network. The country currently holds 35.4% of the
network’s computing capacity. After the Chinese authorities decide to
eradicate anything related to cryptocurrencies, such [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is positively
taken, as America is a more stable and predictable participant in the
crypto market. In addition, the distribution of computing power across
many different territories is a great scenario to improve the security
of the whole network. The second-largest player in the mining industry
is Kazakhstan, but everyone understands that these are the same Chinese
kicked out of their country.

The voices of those who talked about the temporary nature of inflation
have noticeably diminished, and increasingly, we hear about it as a
threat rather than a desirable goal for central bankers. Of course, it
is difficult to think of BTC as a tool to hedge against inflation risks.
Yet, it is one of the main reasons retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, who do not have
many tools in their arsenal to protect their capital from losing
purchasing power due to inflation, are buying cryptocurrencies.

Given Bitcoin’s relatively small market size, we might reasonably expect
this to remain a meaningful booster to its quotations in the wake of
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of rising prices. All conditions are met with money printing, debts
are rising, and the stock valuations are inflated.
