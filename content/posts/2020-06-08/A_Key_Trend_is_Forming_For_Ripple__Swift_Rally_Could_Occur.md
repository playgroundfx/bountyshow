In the past few days, ripple followed a bearish path below the $0.2100
pivot level. XRP price broke the $0.2020 support zone, but it remained
well bid above the $0.2000 support level.

The price is currently consolidating above the $0.2000 support and the
100 simple moving average (4-hours). The last swing high was near
$0.2073 before the price declined towards $0.2000.

A low is formed near $0.1986 and the price is currently rising. XRP is
trading above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from
the $0.2073 high to $0.1986 low. It seems like there is a major
declining channel forming with resistance near $0.2040 on the 4-hours
chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The channel resistance is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of
the recent decline from the $0.2073 high to $0.1986 low. If there is an
upside break above the channel resistance, the price could test the key
$0.2075 resistance zone.

A successful close above the $0.2075 resistance zone could open the
doors for a larger upward move. The next major resistance is near the
$0.2140 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim more gains
towards $0.2250.

On the downside, there is a crucial support forming near $0.2000 and the
100 simple moving average (4-hours). If ripple fails to stay above the
$0.2000 support, there is a risk of a larger decline.

A successful close below the $0.2000 support may perhaps lead the price
towards the $0.1920 and $0.1900 support levels in the near term.

Major Support Levels – $0.2000, $0.1920 and $0.1900.

Major Resistance Levels – $0.2040, $0.2075 and $0.2140.
