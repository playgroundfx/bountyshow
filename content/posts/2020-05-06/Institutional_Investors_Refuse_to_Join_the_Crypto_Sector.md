The on-ramp remains too steep

Investing in Bitcoin, the top listed crypto asset on CoinMarketCap,
remains a significant hurdle for large [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) managers, especially
when considering their perceived risk of Bitcoin. Add to this the
additional purchasing steps necessary, compared to more traditional
assets, and the process of just buying crypto is off-putting. Some
funds’ internal [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) also does not allow investments of specific
products, while others are ousted by the low liquidity in regulated and
approved venues.

Presence does not equal profit or guarantee a bull market

The arrival or presence of institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s does necessarily
translate into buying pressure. Renaissance Technologies Medallion
Funds’s recent entry into CME’s Bitcoin futures markets is a perfect
example. Furthermore, it should be noted that since CME futures are
cash-settled, they don’t necessarily involve any Bitcoin trading
activity. More importantly, a hedge fund can also open short positions.
Futures contracts are not designed for long-term holding.

Compared to traditional markets, the crypto sector is too small

While Bitcoin does produce amazing returns, there are other reasons why
a $94-trillion industry will not just blindly buy cryptocurrencies
anytime soon. No matter how many times one has seen the chart above, it
remains pretty impressive. The crypto sector’s $248 billion market cap
is just a speck among capital markets. Currently, Japanese yen banknotes
in circulation amount to $1 trillion, and this does not include bank
deposits nor treasuries. The world’s 20 largest asset managers combined
oversee $42.3 trillion. A mere 0.5% investment in cryptocurrencies would
end up at $211 billion — equivalent to 84% of the total market cap. At
the moment, cryptocurrencies are in no way a threat to Visa, Wells
Fargo, Chubb or Charles Schwab. It doesn’t matter how well decentralized
finance is performing or how sizable Bitcoin transactions are right now.

Regulatory pressure remains a hurdle  
Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher
Giancarlo admitted in October 2019 that his agency deliberated with the
Treasury, the United States Securities Exchange Commission and the
National Economic Council to suppress Bitcoin’s incredible 2017 rally.
This government-backed plan culminated in December 2017 as CME and CBOE
both listed Bitcoin futures contracts — one day after Bitcoin’s famous
$19,700 top.

More recently, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin
promised “significant new requirements” on cryptocurrencies. In October
2019, U.S. senators went as far as sending out a letter to three
companies backing Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, citing “risks
the project poses to consumers, regulated financial institutions, and
the global financial system.” Despite Bitcoin not being widely regarded
as a competitor to fiat money, it is almost sure that it would be if the
cryptocurrency achieved a trillion-dollar market cap.

Liquidity and ease of access  
BAKKT has a product designed to ease [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s’ significant barrier
to Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin futures contracts with physical delivery
allow purchases throughout an entirely regulated venue, including the
custody process.

As reported by Cointelegraph, BAKKT is controlled by the
Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.
Clients willing to trade such products must do it through the regular
brokers used for stocks and futures. For ages, retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s awaited
BAKKT’s launch, as its arrival was prophesied to be a signal that the
crypto sector had received the blessing of institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
Estimates of a new all-time high being reached in 2018 and 2019 were
relentless and more often than not, wrong. After launch, what seemed
like a perfect solution produced an average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume, which to this
date, remains irrelevant. There are numerous reasons this could be
taking place:

Few brokers currently offer BAKKT’s products.  
Many funds’ internal [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s do not allow the ownership of physical
Bitcoin-based investments.  
Additional bureaucracy (controls) is required for funds to be approved
by BAKKT.  
Physical Bitcoin not accepted as margin for leverage trading.  
Limited Sunday to Friday 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. trading hours.  
Although internal fund [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s can be changed to accommodate Bitcoin
investing, it might not make much sense right now for multi-billion-
dollar investment funds.

Analysts and portfolio managers proposing the addition of a new asset
class in secular [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) managers would be taking an immense
personal risk.

Crypto can and will scale without institutions  
The intention of this piece is not to turn away [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from Bitcoin
and cryptocurrencies. Pundits and analysts with no real market
experience have promised impossible scenarios for far too long. If the
Bitcoin market cap is still under $1 trillion, rest assured you’ve
arrived early to the party, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.
There is possibly an unlimited upside for this asset class, and
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ entrance will almost certainly happen
gradually, then suddenly. Right now, it is essential to realize that a
multi-trillion-dollar [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) industry hasn’t got strong enough
reasons to invest in such a nascent asset class.

Crypto does not need the [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s industry; it is the other way
around. Bitcoin is money for regular people and an investment by itself.
