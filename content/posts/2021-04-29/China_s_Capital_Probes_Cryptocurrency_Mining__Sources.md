BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - The Chinese capital city of Beijing is
conducting a check on data centres involved in cryptocurrency mining to
better understand their impact on energy consumption, according to
sources and a document seen by Reuters.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology on
Tuesday sent an “emergency notice” to the city’s data centre operators
to report if they’re involved in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrency mining
businesses.

If so, they need to report the amount, and share, of power consumed by
cryptocurrency mining, according to the notice.

An official of the bureau, who declined to be identified, said the probe
was directed by city authorities, adding that recipients of the notice
include China’s three biggest telecoms operators.

He said he was not aware of the reason behind the effort, or whether it
is part of a nationwide campaign.

Last month, the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia said it would shut down
all cryptocurrency mining projects by the end of April as part of
broader efforts to improve energy efficiency.

Cryptocurrency miners use specially-designed computer servers to verify
cryptocurrency transactions in the process of producing newly minted
virtual currencies, such as [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

The process requires huge amounts of computing power, and thus
electricity. Chinese regions including Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Yunnan
and Xinjiang are attractive “mining” spots due to low electricity
prices, though Beijing is not seen as a major cryptocurrency mining
centre.

Last week, a sweeping security inspection at power plants in Xinjiang
following a coal mine accident disrupted cryptocurrency mining and
contributed to volatility in [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices.

However, China’s role as a hub for cryptocurrency mining has been eroded
by its ban on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Edward Lu, senior vice president of Canaan Inc, a Chinese maker of
cryptocurrency mining machines, said it increasingly serves clients in
places such as Canada, northern Europe and central Asia, which have
cheap and abundant electricity and clear and predictable [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

> “China used to be a place where cryptocurrency mining was thriving,
but the business is shrinking due to policies,” Lu said.
