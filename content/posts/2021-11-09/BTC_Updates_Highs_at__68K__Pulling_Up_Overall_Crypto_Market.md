Bitcoin has added another 3% since Tuesday morning, pushing to all-time
highs above $68K. BTCUSD is up more than 10% in three days of ongoing
growth, dragging its overall crypto market capitalisation and gaining
speculative interest.

CoinMarketCap now puts the value of all cryptocurrencies at 2.944
trillion – one step away from the circular value of 3 trillion.

On Bitcoin’s [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) charts, the RSI has reached 69, approaching
overbought territory. However, this rarely stops such momentum. Bears
tend to come into play only at the signs of exhaustion of the upside
momentum.

The rest of the whole crypto market is growing slightly slower than
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), with its capitalisation rising 2.7% to $1.658 trillion in the
past 24 hours.

The cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index rose to 84, moving into “extreme
greed” territory, where we last saw it on October 21, the previous wave
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s highs update.

This market disposition sets the stage for a continued cryptocurrency
rally, with new highs for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and a record update for the entire
cryptocurrency market.

As we noted earlier, the prolonged consolidation over the previous weeks
has allowed the bulls to gain strength for the current spurt. The recent
upside momentum could potentially extend to above $83K, up 22% from
current levels.

At the same time, meaningful upside and retracement momentum for the
entire crypto market suggests a less significant upside potential to
$3.1 trillion, up 5.6% from current levels.
