SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bitcoin and ether made record peaks in Asia trade on
Tuesday as enthusiasm for cryptocurrency adoption and fears about
inflation lent support to the asset class.

Bitcoin rose as high as $67,803 and ether, the second-biggest
cryptocurrency by market value, hit $4,825 in early Asian hours.

Both have more than doubled since June and added nearly 70% against the
dollar since the start of October.

> “Crypto is where the fast money is at,” said Chris Weston, head of
research at brokerage Pepperstone. “(Ether) is trending like a dream and
I’d be long and strong here,” he added.

>

> “Clients are net long, with 79% of open positions held long, and I can
sense the $5k party could get going soon.”

[Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) has been gathering since last month’s launch of a futures-based
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) exchange-traded fund in the United States raised expectations of
flow-driven gains.

Bitcoin inflows totalled $95 million last week, representing the largest
inflows of all digital assets, while inflows during an eight-week bull
run for the cryptocurrency were $2.8 billion, the CoinShares data showed
on Monday.

In recent weeks, Australia’s biggest bank has also said it will offer
crypto trading to retail customers, Singaporean authorities have sounded
positive on the asset class and spillover from a positive mood in stocks
has lent support.

The moves have helped lift the total market capitalisation of
cryptocurrencies above $3 trillion, according to crypto price and data
[aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) CoinGecko.

On the CoinMarketCap platform, which tracks 13,796 cryptocurrencies, the
total cryptocurrency market capitalisation was just below $3 trillion at
$2.92 trillion.
