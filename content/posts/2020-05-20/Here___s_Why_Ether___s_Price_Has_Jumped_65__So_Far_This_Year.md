While [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC) is often discussed as the cryptocurrency best suited
for turbulent times, the price of ether (ETH), the second-largest
digital asset by market capitalization, has been substantially
outperforming [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) since the start of 2020. But ether has much
different technical dynamics to consider than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/).

As of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), ether was trading at $211, a loss of less
than a percent over the past 24 hours. The native cryptocurrency of the
Ethereum network was close to its 10-day moving averages, a technical
indicator signaling sideways trading, with little price movement. Ether
dropped as low as $209 earlier in the day on exchanges such as Coinbase,
then hit $215 at 11:00 UTC (7 a.m. ET).

![Here’s Why Ether’s Price Has Jumped 65% So Far This Year][1]

Amid the recent hype about the halving, a once-in-four-years event that
reduced the supply of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and the proclamations of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s like
Paul Tudor Jones II that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) is a good investment in an
extraordinary economic era, ether’s price has outperformed it. For the
year to date, ether is up a whopping 65% while [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has risen 35% for
the same period.

A much smaller market capitalization for ether likely helps ignite
larger price movements versus [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), says Vishal Shah, a
cryptocurrency [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) trader. “ETH’s materially smaller market-cap, on
a nominal basis, thus benefits on the margin.” Ether currently has a $23
billion market capitalization versus [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s $144 billion, according
to data from CoinGecko.

“Ether has long been tracking [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s price action, albeit with higher
beta. This means that when [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) surges in value, ether’s value
usually increases as well by an even greater percentage,” said Michael
Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures.

Anderson’s firm Framework is focused on decentralized finance, or DeFi,
investments. DeFi uses the Ethereum network for various cryptocurrency
services such as stablecoins, lending and derivatives.

The prospect of decentralized financial applications helps fuel interest
in ether as an investment, says Danny Kim, head of revenue for
[cryptocurrency liquidity](https://www.fixpro.org/post/cryptocurrency-liquidity-problem/) provider SFOX. “To the extent that ether is
outperforming [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and becoming a more active network, a big factor
to consider is the DeFi sector,” he told CoinDesk.

Ether holders can “lock” the cryptocurrency into a DeFi [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)
address to gain yields on various lending and stablecoin applications on
the network. Locking ether into DeFi effectively reduces the supply of
ether in circulation for trading, a dynamic that reduces liquidity.
“DeFi has become incredibly popular, and large portions of ETH are
getting locked up as collateral, removing them from the liquid market,”
said Framework’s Anderson.

Indeed, at one time, ether users had locked up over 3.2 million ETH in
network [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s this year, although that number is down from
February highs, according to data analytics firm DeFi Pulse. There are
nearly 111 million ETH outstanding.

Nonetheless, traders still prefer [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s liquidity, regardless of
ether’s year-to-date performance. While ether has $42 million in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
volume on spot exchange Coinbase, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)’s volume is almost three times
higher, averaging $125 million on the San Francisco-based trading
platform. Thus, traders have to carefully balance ether’s profit
potential with the fact that its order books are thinner than [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/),
which can lead to slippage and potential losses when price makes huge
swings. In addition, the Ethereum network is planning to go through an
ambitious technical transition, Eth 2.0, creating a degree of
uncertainty.
