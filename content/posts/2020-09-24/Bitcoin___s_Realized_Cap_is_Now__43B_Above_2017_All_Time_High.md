Crypto market data [aggregator](https://www.fintechee.com/features/price-aggregator/) Glassnode has published data indicating
that Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized capitalization has increased by more than
50% since tagging its all-time high of $20,000 at the end of 2017. The
realized capitalization metric measures the value of each BTC when it
was last moved on-chain, which enables analysts to estimate the
aggregate cost-basis of market participants.

However, coins on centralized exchanges are absent from the metric,
indicating the data is probably more accurate in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the cost-basis
of long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s rather than intra-day speculators. Bitcoin’s
realized cap currently sits at $115 billion — $43 billion more than at
the all-time high in 2017. Bitcoin’s current $190 billion market cap
suggests that the BTC hodlers are presently enjoying an aggregate profit
of 65%.

Coinmetrics’ chart shows that realized capitalization continued to grow
higher in the early months of 2018, pushing to test $90 billion three
times between January and May despite prices having crashed back below
$10,000. While pre-halving speculation saw Bitcoin’s realized cap grow
by 6% in Q2 2020, the violent ‘Black Thursday’ crash quickly reversed
2020’s gains. Since May, the BTC’s realized capitalization has steadily
trended upwards.

According to crypto data researchers IntoTheBlock, more than 72% of
crypto addresses are currently profitable, with the largest sum of
investments having been made in the $1,040 to $5,285, and $8,450 to
$9,560, price ranges.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s (ETH) realized capitalization of $26.3
billion is still a long way from reclaiming its past highs — currently
sitting 25% lower than its 2018 record of $35 billion.
