A Chainlink developer address appears to have been offloading tokens and
putting downward pressure on prices. But things are looking up.
Following a six week downtrend from its all-time high, LINK has
rebounded 30% in the past 24 hours after a reported developer selloff
resulted in downward pressure on the oracle protocol token’s price.

The strong rebound in the Bitcoin price, a sea of green among DeFi coins
and a new Chainlink partnership announcement have all contributed to the
price increase. Chainlink’s native token had fallen over 60% from its
peak of $20 mid-August, bottoming out at crucial support levels around
$7.50 on Thursday, September 24. The six week downtrend appears to have
been been accelerated by multiple sales of large chunks of LINK from
what UK crypto publication Trustnodes reports is the dev address.

This ‘dev address’ has been selling batches of 500,000 tokens, worth
approximately $4.8 million per batch at current prices, regularly over
the past six months. The frequency of sell-offs increased after LINK hit
its all-time high last month. The address shows several outflows to a
Binance address but then the trail goes cold.

There are around 26 million tokens remaining in this address, worth an
estimated $258 million at current prices. Since its peak, LINK market
capitalization has declined from more than $7 billion to around $3
billion currently, however it remains one of the best performing crypto
assets this year surging over 1000% from January 1st to its all-time
high. At current prices, it is still up 450% since New Year’s day.

The price bump came hours after Chainlink announced a partnership with
travel company Travala.com. LINK has been integrated as a payment method
on the crypto friendly hotel booking platform and token holders can book
accommodation in over 2.2 million hotels and homes in 230 countries.

Bitcoin’s momentum may have also had an effect. The king of crypto is
well known for its capacity to move the rest of the market and it too
bounced off support at $10,250 with a gain of 5% in push to $10,750 over
the past 24 hours.
