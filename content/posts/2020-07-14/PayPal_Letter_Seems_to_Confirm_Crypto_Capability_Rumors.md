PayPal has confirmed that it is developing capabilities in the
cryptocurrency space, according to a letter to the European Commission.
Originally submitted on March 20, the document was intended as a
response to the European Commission’s public consultation on building a
European Union framework for markets in crypto assets, whose feedback
period lasted from December 2019 through March.

In the letter, the payments giant admitted to “continuously monitoring
and evaluating global developments in the crypto and
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)/distributed ledger space,” stressing that it favors a
“harmonized” regulatory approach that wouldn’t compromise innovation.
Further, PayPal addressed its relationship with crypto assets, noting
that in 2019, it joined the Libra Association to learn “more about the
proposed use of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technologies to provide financial services to
unbanked populations across the globe,” but later dropped out because it
started to work on its own solutions in the space:

Earlier in June, it was reported that PayPal was considering introducing
direct sales of crypto assets and offering users to store their crypto
using the company’s in-house digital wallet. When asked to confirm or
deny that information, a representative for the payments juggernaut told
Cointelegraph that “PayPal does not comment on rumors or speculation.”
Around the same time, PayPal announced two crypto-related openings, as
it was looking for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and crypto engineers.
