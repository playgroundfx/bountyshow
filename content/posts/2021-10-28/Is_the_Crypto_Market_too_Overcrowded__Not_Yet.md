The cryptocurrency market moved into a correction phase after Bitcoin’s
dip. From the US session until the beginning of active trading in
Europe, the first cryptocurrency steadily traded below $60K but jumped
above this round level from the start of the European session.
Nevertheless, for the week, the coin is losing almost 10%. If we are
seeing a local bottom now, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is good enough.

Some believe what is happening is a quick balancing process and
preparation before the push for new highs. Others think it’s the
beginning of a broader correction that will take BTC to $45K-$50K. In
case Bitcoin falls to these lows, both these optimists and pessimists
will buy.

Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) has received another update, and although the
final phases of the roadmap are still a long way off, it is always seen
positively by crypto market participants. Despite the retreat from the
highs, the second cryptocurrency is holding above $4K.

Total cryptocurrency capitalisation is $2.5 trillion, near historic
highs. Bitcoin’s dominance index is at a comfortable value of about
44.5%, reflecting the broad demand across the crypto market.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has surrendered ground recently but
remains firmly in “greed” mode. The RSI for BTCUSD on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart is
retreating further from the overbought area. Both indicators point to a
widening space for further Bitcoin growth.

Several altcoins stood out firmly and are now at the centre of the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
agenda. We are talking about the confrontation between the two meme
tokens, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. At one point, SHIBA INU’s capitalisation
exceeded $50 billion, pushing XRP out of 7th place on CoinMarketCap. Of
course, such episodes of growth are followed by a correction.
Nevertheless, the situation is quite remarkable. The community considers
SHIBA INU to be the “killer” of Dogecoin. But the crypto market space is
quite enough for these two projects to coexist in harmony, with
speculators switching from one to the other.

Another bright hero of the last few days was a 1inch token, which at
some point jumped in price by 100% within a day. The coin got help from
such fundamental factors as listing on the Upbit exchange and increased
user activity.

As before, the crypto market continues to generate lightning-fast
success stories attracting more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the sector, hoping to make
quick and big money. Crypto casinos continue to work and win. Before the
end of the year, we may see a new episode of ups and downs in the
sector, and it looks like a new Bitcoin price high will cause an
explosive demand for digital assets.
