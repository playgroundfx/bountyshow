NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday sued
the founder of the now-defunct [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) platform
BitConnect over his alleged role in [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulently raising about $2
billion from thousands of retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Expanding a civil case announced in May, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission charged BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani, an
Indian citizen, with lying about BitConnect’s ability to generate
profits, and violating registration laws meant to protect [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

In a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, the SEC also charged promoter
Glenn Arcaro and his firm Future Money Ltd with [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulently receiving
more than $24 million in “referral commissions” and other sums as
BitConnect’s top U.S. promoter.

Arcaro pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a related criminal wire [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)
conspiracy charge before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mitchell Dembin in San
Diego. His sentencing is Nov. 15.

The SEC lawsuit seeks to impose fines, recoup ill-gotten gains, and
other relief.

Founded in 2016, BitConnect created a digital token called BitConnect
Coin that could be exchanged for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), the popular cryptocurrency.

The SEC said [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in a BitConnect “lending program” were told
BitConnect used a “volatility software trading bot” that could generate
returns of 40% per month, and were given fictitious returns showing
3,700% annualized gains.

But the regulator said [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lost much of their money after the
price of BitConnect Coin sank 92% on Jan. 16, 2018.

Prosecutors said BitConnect ran a “textbook Ponzi scheme” by paying
earlier [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) money.

Kumbhani, 35, has lived in Surat, India but his whereabouts are unknown,
while Arcaro, 44, lives in Los Angeles and incorporated Future Money in
Hong Kong, authorities said.

Efforts to locate Kumbhani were unsuccessful. Arcaro’s lawyer did not
respond to requests for comment.

The SEC sued five other BitConnect promoters on May 28.

It has obtained judgments requiring two promoters, Michael Noble and
Joshua Jeppesen, and Jeppesen’s fiancee to pay more than $3.5 million
and 190 [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). The other promoters have not responded to the lawsuit
or not been served.
