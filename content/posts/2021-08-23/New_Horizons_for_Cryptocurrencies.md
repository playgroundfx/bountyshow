The crypto market appeared to be in a state of mild excitement when
Bitcoin surpassed $50K for the first time since May 15th. It is hard to
say how sustainable this level may be, as the bulls’ strength has now
clearly gone into decline. Nevertheless, the very fact that the
benchmark cryptocurrency can overcome such an important technical and
psychological level is good support for a positive assessment of the
prospects of the crypto market.

Bitcoin has been supported by a number of factors, including the active
phase of accumulation of the asset, as well as the equally active phase
of withdrawal of the coin from [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s’ balance sheets.
This is a clear sign of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ desire to move into the phase of
holding the asset in anticipation of growth. In addition, the active
growth of the Bitcoin network hash rate, which crypto market
participants often associate with the change of the asset’s price, may
also have an impact.

Over the last 5 weeks, Bitcoin has been closing in the green zone, which
also acts as a strong factor of support from the market analysis. Amid
the financial success of one of the leading crypto exchanges, Coinbase,
the company announced its intention to buy $500 million worth of
cryptocurrencies. In addition, PayPal announced that from today, UK
residents would have access to the platform’s crypto services.

Against this backdrop, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index of Bitcoin and
major cryptocurrencies switched to “extreme greed” mode yesterday. The
higher it is, the closer the sell-off is. Nevertheless, with the
traditional market bubble becoming increasingly inflated, it is safe to
assume that bullish sentiment may well be sustained even amid an
extremely overheated market.

The total capitalization of the crypto market continues to grow and is
moving toward $2.2 trillion. Bitcoin is the undisputed crypto market
leader, and with a few exceptions, it sets the tone for all altcoins.
According to analyst firm Chainalysis, global acceptance of
cryptocurrencies has jumped almost 900% over the past year.

Unexpected data also came about Afghanistan, which Chainalysis ranked
20th out of 154 in the context of cryptocurrency adoption. Last year,
the company did not include the country in this [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) at all. Thus, as
represented by this country, it is quite possible to assume that by the
end of 2021, the crypto market in general and Bitcoin, in particular,
have the potential for large-scale market penetration in developing
countries with new price horizons for major cryptocurrencies.
