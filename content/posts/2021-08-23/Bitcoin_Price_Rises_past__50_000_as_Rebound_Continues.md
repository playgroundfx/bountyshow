LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s price surged past $50,000 on Monday for the
first time since May, continuing its rebound from a months-long slump.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose to $50,341, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bet
that the prospect of more U.S. stimulus spending would lead to further
gains, and more mainstream financial services firms made moves in the
nascent asset class.

Bitcoin has risen 81% since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January.

Meanwhile, the price of rival cryptocurrency ether rose 2.8% to $3,337.
The virtual coin has risen 91% since slumping to below $1,740 last
month.

The cryptocurrency recovery comes as some more established financial
services companies offer their customers access to virtual coins. PayPal
Holdings Inc said on Monday it would allow customers in the UK to buy,
sell and hold [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies starting this week.

Some traders believe the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market has yet to see the full return
of retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, suggesting the current upswing could have further
to go.

> “The last time [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) was at $50,000, the Google trends (tracking
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) showing Bitcoin searches) was much higher than what it is now,”
Marcus Sotiriou, a sales trader at the UK based digital asset broker
GlobalBlock, said in a note.

> “This suggests that retail euphoria hasn’t entered the market yet and
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has a long way to go in this market cycle.”
