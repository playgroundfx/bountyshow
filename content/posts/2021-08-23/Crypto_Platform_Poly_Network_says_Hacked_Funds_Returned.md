HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency platform Poly Network said on
Monday that almost all of the $610 million stolen this month in one of
the biggest crypto heists had now been returned by the unknown person or
persons behind the attack.

In a Twitter post, Poly Network said it had regained control of all the
assets except for $33 million in stablecoin tether that had been frozen
by the company that manages it. The network said it was in talks with
tether about unfreezing those funds.

The hackers had previously said they did the attack for fun to expose a
vulnerability in the platform’s digital contracts and it was always
their plan to return the tokens. Some [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) analysts have
speculated they just found it too difficult to launder so much stolen
cryptocurrency.

A lesser-known name in the world of crypto, Poly Network is a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that facilitates peer-to-peer
transactions with a focus on allowing users to transfer or swap tokens
across different [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s.

Poly Network announced the hack on Aug. 10 but said the perpetrators had
started returning the digital coins the following day. The network also
offered the hacker or hackers a $500,000 “bug bounty”.
