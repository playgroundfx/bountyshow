According to CoinGecko, the total capitalization of the crypto market
increased by 9.9% in a week, to $2.14 trillion. The Bitcoin Dominance
Index added 0.2% to 40.6%.

The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index rose 11 points to 60 in one day,
moving into greed territory.

Bitcoin rose for the second week in a row against the backdrop of
strengthening stock indices. On Sunday, BTC broke through strong
resistance around $45,000, which reversed its downward movement several
times in February and early March. The technical picture favours further
gains as Bitcoin climbed above the 100-day moving average (MA) for the
first time since early December and heads towards the 200-day MA
($48,200).

A possible driver of the uptrend in BTC are rumours about the intentions
of the non-profit organization Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to invest in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). On March 27, it became known that LFG bought more than $1.1
billion worth of coins to ensure the stability of the Terra USD (UST)
algorithmic stablecoin.

The best dynamics among altcoins was demonstrated by Cardano against the
backdrop of the announcement of ADA staking by the Coinbase crypto
exchange.

Meanwhile, well-known crypto critic Peter Schiff again criticized the
cryptocurrency, comparing it to a financial bubble and calling it stupid
for people to save their savings from inflation by buying BTC. According
to Schiff, cryptocurrencies have no real value and are backed by
peopleâ€™s trust in the same way as fiat currency.
