On Jan. 21 the cryptocurrency market experienced an increased wave of
selling pressure and within the last hour Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped
below the $30,000 mark for the first time since Jan. 4. Now that Bitcoin
has lost the $32,000 and $30,000 support, a growing number of analysts
are suggesting that the price could retest the $24,000 support. One
theory behind the dip suggests that institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s viewed
Bitcoin as a crowded trade and decided to take profits.

As reported by Cointelegraph, Scott Minerd, the Guggenheim’s chief
investment officer, recently suggested that the price of Bitcoin has
“likely put in a top” for 2021 and could see a “retracement back toward
the 20,000 level.” JPMorgan strategists John Normand and Federico
Manicardi also warned that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s using BTC “as a portfolio
diversifier are putting themselves at risk” as Bitcoin is more of a
cyclical asset than a hedge.

This note of caution seems to have been well timed given today’s show of
volatility. Although sell-offs can be painful for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who are
overleverged, taking a closer look at some of the social activity that
occurred during the downside move hints that the current volatility
might not be a macro trend change.
