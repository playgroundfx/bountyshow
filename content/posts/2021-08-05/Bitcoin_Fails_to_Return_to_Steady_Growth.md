The benchmark cryptocurrency remains at $38K on Thursday, again running
into a sell-off after a slight growth to $39.6K. The price fluctuations
occur at shallow trading volumes, making the reliability of price
bounces likely to be highly questionable.

![Bitcoin Fails to Return to Steady Growth][1]

On the data analysis side, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) got support from buyers on Wednesday
on the downside to the 200-day simple moving average but failed to build
on the upside, returning to that line on Thursday. Although it is
important to keep in mind that for the past two months (almost forever
for the crypto market), the first cryptocurrency has failed to grow
above $40K.

The other day, comments by new SEC head Gary Gensler got crypto market
participants very excited. The attention to his statement could be
compared to one of the Fedâ€™s members. Investors tried to catch the mood
and hints of the new head of SEC, which surprised even Gensler. His
attitude could be interpreted as unfavourable for the current order of
the crypto market.

The US authorities will tighten the rules, increase transparency, and do
everything possible to protect [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. All this means de-
anonymisation, pressure on crypto exchanges, and legalisation of all
digital assets. However, apart from regulating cryptocurrencies, the
tasks of the new SEC head are so many that digital assets are not on the
pressing agenda.

Separately from that, US authorities said they intend to collect about
$28 billion from cryptocurrency taxes. The lawmakers propose to raise
this money by applying new requirements to exchanges and other
significant participants in the crypto market.

On the positive side, Glassnode data showed the highest recent [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
outflows from centralised exchanges. About 40,000 BTC were withdrawn in
just one week. The flow exceeds 100K per month. Now only just over 13%
of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) turnover is on [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s. In theory, this
means that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not ready to get rid of their coins right now,
which could point to a return of growth in the long run.

Also on the positive side, one could consider the resumption of allowing
crypto projects to buy ads from Google. The ban was made in June 2018 on
the wave of popularity of ICOs, among which there were a lot of
[fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent ones. That is why now only regulated cryptocurrency
organisations will be able to buy ads.
