The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday charged
Ripple, the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) payments company associated with the
cryptocurrency XRP, with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered
securities offering. The SEC also charged two executives of San
Francisco-based Ripple for personal gains they received from the
offering.

Ripple created and sold XRP, the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market
value. Globally, financial regulators are still assessing how they
should regulate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and its rivals. Future
court battles could determine whether cryptocurrencies make the leap
from a niche to a mainstream asset. Ripple has said XRP is a currency
and does not have to be registered as an investment contract. “The SEC
is fundamentally wrong as a matter of law and fact,” the company said on
Tuesday.

Beginning in 2013, Ripple’s former chief executive, Christian Larsen,
and its current CEO, Bradley Garlinghouse, raised capital through the
sale of digital assets in an unregistered offering.

The company also “distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-cash
consideration, such as labor and market-making services,” the SEC said,
adding that Larsen and Garlinghouse personally profited by approximately
$600 million from their unregistered sales of XRP.

The SEC is seeking an injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest
and civil penalties from Ripple, the agency said, without specifying how
much.
