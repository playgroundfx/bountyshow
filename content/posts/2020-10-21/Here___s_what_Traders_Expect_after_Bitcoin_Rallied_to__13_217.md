On Oct. 21 Bitcoin (BTC) price overtook the $13K mark to reach $13,217
after traders took out key resistance levels at $11,900, $12,000, and
$12,500 in the last 48-hours. While there are various technical reasons
behind the abrupt upsurge, there are three key factors buoying the
rally.

The three catalysts are a favorable technical structure, PayPal enabling
cryptocurrency purchases, and Bitcoin’s rising dominance rate.

PayPal’s crypto announcement adds to BTC’s momentum  
Earlier today, PayPal officially announced that it is allowing users to
buy and sell cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. In an official
statement, Dan Schulman, the president and CEO of PayPal, confirmed the
cryptocurrency integration. He wrote: “We are eager to work with central
banks and regulators around the world to offer our support, and to
meaningfully contribute to shaping the role that digital currencies will
play in the future of global finance and commerce.”  
Following PayPal’s statement, the price of Bitcoin immediately rose from
around $12,300 to as high as $12,900.

Bitcoin dominance is rising  
In the past week, Bitcoin has outperformed alternative cryptocurrencies,
decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, and Ethereum. Josh Olszewicz, a
cryptocurrency technical analyst, said the dominance of BTC is above a
key moving average. Technically, this suggests that Bitcoin could
continue to outperform altcoins in the near term.

BTC shows a bullish high time frame structure  
Throughout October, traders have pinpointed the favorable technical
structure of Bitcoin on the higher time frames. Bitcoin’s weekly chart,
in particular, has shown a breakout and surpassed the previous local top
achieved in August. Two months ago, BTC topped out at $12,468 on Binance
and proceeded to fall below $10,000. As mentioned earlier, today’s high
volume surge took the price to a new 2020 high at $13,217, which is well
above the previous local top.
