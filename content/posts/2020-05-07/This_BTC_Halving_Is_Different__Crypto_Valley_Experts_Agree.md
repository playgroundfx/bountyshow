With the Bitcoin halving just four days away, CV Lab, an incubator and
co-working space for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) companies, along with Cointelegraph,
invited a group of eight experts from Switzerland Crypto Valley for a
live panel discussion held on May 7.

The Crypto Valley experts came to a consensus that this Bitcoin block
reward halving would be different from the previous two, regardless of
which direction the price of Bitcoin (BTC) goes. The experts agreed that
the macroeconomics’ environment is changing. More and more people are
considering storing their life savings in Bitcoin as a hedge against the
current troubled monetary system.

The power has also started to shift from miners to the community and
traders, according to Arnaud Salomon, CEO of Mt Pelerin. He explained:
The power has shifted away from miners. They’re not in the same position
as they used to be ten years ago or even five years ago […]. The stock
is already so big and because today there is a lot of Bitcoin in
circulation people are willing to trade and exchange.

Event moderator Alexandre Juncker and author of “Blockchain Quarterly”
said the halving highlights Bitcoin’s monetary mission to oppose
arbitrary monetary policies conducted by central banks. He noted:

We witness the very moment when a vast economic crisis triggered by a
pandemic is threatening to overwhelm already over-indebted States. In
the turmoil to come, the value-proposition of debased unstoppable pure
Bitcoin whose money supply is written in code is likely to meet popular
adoption flying away from fiat hyperinflation in many countries.

Additionally, Bitcoin adds discipline rather than competes with the
existing financial system, according to Yves Longchamp, head of research
at Seba bank. He stressed that BTC offers an alternative, which people
can voluntarily use for storing value in something that is not
correlated with other financial assets.
