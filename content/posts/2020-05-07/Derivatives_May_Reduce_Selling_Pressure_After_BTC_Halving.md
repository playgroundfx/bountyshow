In early trading at 00:00 UTC, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency was
around $8,957 before jumping as high as $9,399 at 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. EDT)
on spot exchanges including Coinbase. It was changing hands at a price
above its 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages,
signaling bullish sentiment Wednesday. At press time [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) (BTC) was
trading up 3.8% over 24 hours at $9,258.

Big-name [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital has been
making the rounds this week, talking about how he views digital scarcity
driving [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices higher after next week’s expected halving event.
“Next Tuesday we have the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) halving where the inflation rate gets
cut in half,” Novogratz said on CNBC’s Closing Bell program Monday. “You
talk about inflation in fiat currencies where the [Federal Reserve] is
printing money like a money-printing machine and in the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) space
the money supply gets cut.”

This may be true, but it also means a smaller reward and thus smaller
revenue for miners to pay labor, rent and electricity. That’s because
they will have fewer [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) inflows they can sell for cash. However, in
July 2016, the last time [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) supply was cut in half, the market was
much different.

Garrick Hileman, an economist and a long-time researcher in the crypto
space currently at wallet provider Blockchain.com, says things have
changed since the previous halving halving event. For example, CME
didn’t start offering [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) futures until late 2017. Ahead of this
halving, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) miners can purchase futures contracts, locking in
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) prices to pay for their expenditures.

Open positions on CME futures recently hit a 10-month high. However, the
U.S.-based platform takes up only a small fraction of the market. The
biggest players in the crypto derivatives market — such as Huobi,
Binance BitMEX and OKex — are based in Asia and don’t accept U.S.
customers.
