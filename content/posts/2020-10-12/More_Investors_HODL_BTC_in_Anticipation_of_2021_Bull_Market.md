New data shows Bitcoin’s (BTC) current price action is showing higher
levels of ‘HODLing’ activity than previous bull cycles. According to on-
chain analyst Willy Woo, an indicator called “reflexivity” has been
increasing in recent months. Woo explained that the indicator measures
Bitcoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ tendency to hold onto their BTC as its price rises.
It’s essentially an alternative way to gauge the HODLing activity of
retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

market][1]

There are several reasons why retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might be holding onto
their BTC even more so than in previous bull cycles. If Bitcoin rallies
in 2021, most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would see it as a post-halving bull rally.
Historically, BTC has rallied 12 to 15 months after each halving,
recording a new all-time high each time. Based on the tendency of BTC to
rally after a halving, retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might be holding as a strategy
to avoid being priced out if a strong sustained rally begins.

Bitcoin has also shown a surprising level of resilience throughout
multiple potential black swan events. After its initial recovery from
the pandemic-induced crash in March, it has stayed above $10,000 despite
numerous negative events. Most recently, the price of Bitcoin slumped
after the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged
BitMEX with violating the Bank Secrecy Act. After the CFTC announcement
BTC price fell below $10,500 but it quickly recovered to the $10,700
support level.

The U.S. presidential election and Q4 may push BTC price higher.
Industry executives and prominent [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the cryptocurrency
industry foresee the upcoming presidential election in November
benefiting Bitcoin. Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, said a
Democratic sweep would catalyze Bitcoin due to various macro factors. He
also suggested that a second term for Trump could also benefit Bitcoin.
He wrote: “Biden is extremely bullish for BTC because democrat blue wave
could usher in unprecedented installation of MMT agenda w/ corresponding
dollar weakness and deficits. With that said Trump is also bullish.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, traders including Peter
Brandt believe higher time frame charts point to a strong uptrend for
Bitcoin. The combination of favorable technicals, strengthening
fundamentals, and rising HODLing activity could buoy a BTC bull run in
2021.
