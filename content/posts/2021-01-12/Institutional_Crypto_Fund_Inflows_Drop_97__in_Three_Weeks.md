Capital inflows into crypto funds and investment products plummeted
during the first week of January after posting new all-time highs in
late-December. According to crypto fund manager CoinShares’ Jan. 11
Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the first week of trading in the new
year saw just $29 million flow into institutional crypto products.
That’s a greater than 97% decline from the $1.09 billion invested during
the week before Christmas. Volumes are likely to have been dampened by
traders taking holidays over the new year.

However the firm also notes that December’s surging inflows have been
followed by recent “evidence of potential profit taking,” with multiple
crypto investment products recording weekly outflows in early January.

As of Jan. 8, CoinShares estimated that $34.4 billion in capital was
held in crypto investment products — of which $27.5 billion, or 80%, was
in locked BTC funds, while $4.7 billion, or roughly 13.5%, was invested
in ETH products.

The report notes that Bitcoin funds have also produced stronger volumes
recentl than during the December 2017 bull run, stating: “We have seen
much greater [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) participation this time round with net new assets
at US$8.2bn compared to only US$534m in December 2017.”
