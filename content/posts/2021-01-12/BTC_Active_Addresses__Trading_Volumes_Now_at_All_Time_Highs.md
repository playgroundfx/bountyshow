Data from CryptoCompare shows that [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) trading volumes on the eight
major exchanges tracked on the CoinDesk 20 have passed $11 billion, a
new all-time high from the previous record during 2017’s crypto bull
market.

> “This is first and foremost a sign of how much bigger and mature the
industry is, with a lot more money flowing on these exchanges,” Bendik
Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. “It
is great to see higher volumes, making the market more liquid and
efficient.”

The surging volume due to Monday’s sell-off came in part from newcomers
to the market, according to Schei. “Some of this volume is definitely
from new and unexperienced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s entering the market for the first
time and panicking when the price starts falling,” he said. “These
corrections are necessary and healthy, even in a bull market.”

At the same time, the number of active [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) addresses has also broke
its previous record on Jan. 8, according to data from Glassnode. “At its
highest point last week, over 1.3 million [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) addresses were active
in a single day,” the on-chain data analytics firm wrote in its weekly
market report on Jan. 11. “This continued spike indicates an impressive
level of new adoption and activity for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), and suggests that the
number of market participants in the network may be higher than ever
before.”
