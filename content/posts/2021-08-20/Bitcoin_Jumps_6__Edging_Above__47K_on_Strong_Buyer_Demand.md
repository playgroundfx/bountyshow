![Bitcoin Jumps 6% Edging Above $47K on Strong Buyer Demand][1]

Bitcoin is up more than 6% on the day after breaching $47,000 on the
back of strong buyer demand. The world’s largest crypto has hit a
24-hour high of $47,359 and is now posting a 62.2% year-to-date return,
CoinDesk data shows. Current prices are resting just above the $47,000
price tag with one BTC ( 4.9%) fetching roughly $47,100.

> “What we’re seeing are market participants testing this level and
reacting to the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Coinbase,” said Daniel Kim, head of
capital markets at Australia-based decentralized lending company Maple
Finance. Hourly spot volume across multiple exchanges also clocked the
highest point in a week (Aug. 13), meanwhile, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume on Thursday
registered higher volume than the day prior confirming the upward
momentum.

> “We’ve been hearing commentary that hedge funds were viewing
$45,000-$50,000 as a key level for it to be a ‘[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) market,’ Kim
said. “Over the past 2 weeks, we’ve seen our institutional USDC (-0.03%)
borrowing demand significantly grow.”
