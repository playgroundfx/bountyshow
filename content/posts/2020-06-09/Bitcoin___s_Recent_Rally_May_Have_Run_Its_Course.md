Bitcoin fans have been heartened by its recent rally, but a technical
indicator points to a potential slump ahead. Based on the DVAN Buying
and Selling Pressure Indicator, which depicts bull/bear trends, Bitcoin
fell below the trend line for the first time since late May, suggesting
the coin may be forming a new selling pattern. The world’s largest
digital token sees resistance at $10,000 and any drop will likely first
test $9,500, which would imply a 2% retreat from current levels.

Bitcoin dropped 0.4% as of 11:25 a.m. in New York to trade around
$9,678. Peer tokens including Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin also retreated.
The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks major digital
currencies, was down as much as 1.1% at its session low.

Crypto fans have seen prices surge this year thanks to projections that
digital tokens can benefit as central banks and governments around the
world unleash stimulus measures to shore up listing economies. And while
many crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and fans continue to remain bullish given the
token’s 35% gain this year, some of Wall Street’s best-known names have
also come to embrace it, further buoying sentiment.

> “Bitcoin was conceived following the last financial crisis. It will
come of age and mature as a result of this financial crisis,” said
Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares. “While the
investment community is still mixed in its views on Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies, the trading and infrastructure ecosystem is absolutely
booming, and consumer on-ramps continue to grow and evolve.”
